    "# Executive Summary\n",
    "This analysis utilized machine learning models to determine optimal business strategies for a new food service venture in Alabama, focusing on location selection and menu development.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Location Analysis\n",
    "Two clustering models, K-means and DBSCAN, were employed to identify ideal locations for business establishment:\n",
    "* K-means (Silhouette Score: 0.443, Inertia: 15436534561.065)\n",
    "* DBSCAN (Silhouette Score: 0.288, Inertia: 15436534561.065)\n",
    "* Both models consistently highlighted Madison and Mobile counties as prime areas for initial investment. These locations offer a balance of population density and income levels, avoiding oversaturated markets while ensuring sufficient customer base, and should both be tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Menu and Marketing Strategy\n",
    "Two classification models, Logistic Regression and Random Forest, were used to determine optimal menu items and advertising focus:\n",
    "* Logistic Regression (Accuracy: 0.9045, Precision: 0.9094, Recall: 0.9045, F1 Score: 0.9038)\n",
    "* Random Forest (Accuracy: 0.8886, Precision: 0.8964, Recall: 0.8886, F1 Score: 0.8874)\n",
    "* Key findings include: Focus items: Chicken, Potatoes, Beans; Items to avoid: Sushi, Caviar, Crab\n",
    "* These results align with the goal of targeting cost-effective, popular items among lower-income groups while avoiding high-cost ingredients.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendations\n",
    "- Establish initial operations and test in Madison and Mobile county\n",
    "- Develop a menu centered around chicken, potatoes, and beans, etc.\n",
    "- Concentrate paid search advertising on keywords related to these core ingredients\n",
    "- Use high-cost items like sushi, caviar, and crab, etc. as negative keywords in advertising campaigns\n",
    "This data-driven approach positions the business for success by targeting the right location and customer base while optimizing menu offerings and marketing strategies."

    "# Problem Statement:\n",
    "As a data scientist at a startup food ghost kitchen company in Alabama, I have been tasked with market research that includes analyzing data on food value, food keywords, nutrition habits, physical activity levels, and obesity rates, and other factors, to identify distinct market segments across the state and determine top menu items to deliver. The goal is to develop models that will enable targeted marketing campaigns and tailored menu offerings, presenting the top locations with recommendations for top menu items and keywords to use for advertisement."

    "  * Avoid top population area - need to have room to grow and expand, don't want to fail and have nothing but smaller areas to consider\n",
    "  * Avoid low populatio area - need to have enough people to advertise and sell to to make a reasonable profit\n",
    "- Logistic Regression and Random Forest: Determine the best menu items to buy at scale and the best foods to advertise on in paid search\n",
    "- * Focus on foods that are low cost to maximize net revenue of high volume purchases\n",
    "  * Focus on meals and ingredients that are popular with lower income groups to make sure there is enough volume of search terms\n",
    "  * Avoid foods that are high cost because they will not be on the menu and their search terms should be used as negative keywords"
