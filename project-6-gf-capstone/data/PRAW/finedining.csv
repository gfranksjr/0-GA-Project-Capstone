1735992083.0,Ambience photos ,"Love the restaurant review posts on here. As a Avid finediner, I often check in this sib before booking. 

One thing I would I always appreciate is when the reviewer also includes images of the restaurant and dining room, besides the food. 
I understand, food's the focus but ambience, interior design, lighting is very often a huge factor in my decision to pull the trigger on a reservation. It often gives me a good indication 
if it's my style or not in a way that a played dish wouldn't be able to. ",finedining
1735991126.0,Andrew Fairlie** (Scotland) ,"Dined at 2 starred Andrew Fairlie, located at Scotlands best hotel, Gleneagels. The food was very mediocre and in my opinion not 2 starred. Everything was well executed but just lacked depth and nuance. Service was good and friendly. Pacing was too slow and I was bored. 

Here are the dishes for the tasting menu:
-Bluefin Tuna
-Scotch Beef Tartare
- King Scallop 
- Halibut
- Scottish Lobster
- Roe Deer
- Bramble Crumble Soufflé  

Price was £195. Not a place a will return.

1735966968.0,"cépages - Gunma, Japan","Not quite sure how I originally found this place (can't find mention of it on this subreddit, and got the impression we were some of the first tourists to visit), but had it marked on my Google maps and it was pretty straight forward to book, while being highly rated on tabelog (>4, with only 24 reviews), so decided to dine here during my Japan trip over Christmas. 

The restaurant is about a 1.5 hour journey from Tokyo. The chef and restaurant manager (the only two people working in the restaurant that sat 5 diners) previously worked together at L'Effervescence and the chef is particularly inspired by CHIUnE. I've never been to the latter, but he mentioned asking the architect to design a similar restaurant space for cépages. Worth noting the chef speaks limited English but I don't think the barrier would be too bad for a non-Japanese speaker. We dined with local friend who was able to translate anything that the staff had trouble conveying. 

The food was very good, although I wasn't a fan of the overuse of (pretty average) black truffle at times, but that's a personal preference. A couple of highlights were the prosciutto toast (pic 1) and the unagi dish (pic 3) which had very crispy skin. The most memorable part of the meal, however, was the wine pairing. Most bottles in the pairing were around 10-20k yen bottles, with 2021 Nana-Tsu-Mori and a 1998 Chateau Haut-Brion for mains being a lot more expensive and obvious highlights. It did feel like wine was a real focus of this restaurant, hence its name, and I imagine they can't be making much profit on the pairing given the price. Food and wine pairing were both around 35k yen each (so roughly 70k yen pp). ",finedining
1735966162.0,Californios ** San Francisco ,"Had the opportunity to dine at Californios in December 2024 and overall had an amazing experience.

Quick rundown on dishes in chronological order-

1. Agustin Fresca: Apple cider topped with Fuji Apples
2. Chilapita: Cranberry bean mouse, salsa topped with caviar from Tsar Nicoulai 
3. Tostada: Blue fin tuna, avocado mouse and reserve caviar
4. Sope: Dungeness crab, Chantelle mushrooms, and shaved Perigord truffle
5. Aguachile: Citrus, mandarins, blood orange, local Yuzu. Finished with sorbet with all the juices.
6. Chipotle: Lobster, smoked trout roe, broth made from lobster shell
7. Halibut: Halibut with sourdough tortilla
8. Tamal: Filled with buffalo mozzarella and pak mole
9. Codorniz: Al pastor with grilled pineapple on hickory gold tortilla with smoked quail broth
10. Camote y mole: Camote served with mole blanco and negro served on sesame tortilla
11. Pescado: Rockfish with fresh tortilla, black turtle beans and herbs.
12. Frutas: Granita with pink guava, fresh Cara Caras served with citrus tea
13. Empanada:  Made with Granny Smith apples, with rum ice cream and buttered pecan.
14. Chocolate assortments: 4 variations.

Highlights for me was the Halibut tortilla and I was in love with the black turtle beans.

Drinks: Not pictured but as my wife was pregnant she opted for non-alcoholic pairing which was first for her. She enjoyed most outside the one version of beer they had. 

Service: Everyone was warm, friendly and service felt smooth and polished. We were there at earliest sitting at 5pm and before we knew it 3 hours plus had flown by.

Extras: They provided us with scented candles and we were lucky enough to get tour of kitchen meet Chef Val and team.

Overall I couldn’t recommend this restaurant enough.

1735965968.0,"Valhalla, Chicago (winter menu 2024)","Visited Valhalla on a layover in Chicago after Christmas and wanted to share my impressions. I saw that someone already posted the current menu but as I was so thoroughly impressed by the well thought out menu and the friendly and attentive service I thought I’d share anyway. This was my first time visiting a fine dining restaurant in the US (and the first time doing so on my own) and my expectations were quite high after reading so many positive comments about Valhalla on this subreddit. Before booking I was torn between this and Oriole and looking back I’m almost sad that I didn’t just do both. 

Comparing Valhalla to the fine dining restaurants I’ve been to in Europe and Asia I would without a doubt put Valhalla in the top of the 1 star category, definitely not far off from 2 stars. The menu and presentation were precise and vibrant, the flavors were inventive and unique (bless every chef who’s not afraid of spicyness) and the order of the dishes felt incredibly well thought out. 

Highlights for me were the first trio of dishes with muscles, the mushroom kebab, the water aged fish and the beef breast. The desserts were also all fantastic and I thankfully none of them were just some mousse, foam or sorbet. They all had an extra kick or crunch to them.

The only thing that bothered me a bit was that we were SPRINTING through the menu. Maybe it was because I was by myself so the only smalltalk I could have was with the staff, but sometimes I felt like they wanted to get me out as fast as possible to make room for two more guests. But could’ve probably just asked them to take bigger breaks between courses. ",finedining

1735939438.0,"Humble Chicken, London 1*",Visited in October. Counter seats are fun as a solo diner and the staff were friendly and chatty.

Wow, just wow. This might have been the best meal I've ever had. Every single dish was phenomenal, even the beet dish and I hate beets. The service was top notch and I enjoyed how you sit at the bar for the first three bites then stand in the kitchen for the foie gras before heading to your table, made everything seem like more of an experience. I'm honestly shocked this is two stars and not three because everything seemed so perfectly done. I would fly back to Chicago just to eat here again. Seriously cannot recommend Oriole enough. $325 + 20% service charge ($65)",finedining
1735925745.0,"Ōre - Bangkok, Thailand","Ōre - Bangkok, Thailand
On December 1st, 2024 my wife and I went to our first counter service fine dining resturant, Ōre.  First off, thank you u/AcanthocephalaOwn188 for your review here, it inspired us to dine at Ōre rather than many of the other great options in Bangkok.

Located in the BK Salon, the staff greet you in the first building which appears to be a coffee/drink counter.  We were about 25 minutes early to our 2nd seating reservation (we were warned that we cannot trust Bangkok traffic).The resturant suggests arriving 10 minutes early so you can determine your drinks prior to food.  The staff asked us to sit in the small waiting area, served us cold water and presented us with the drink menu for Ōre.  It is a wine list by the bottle, thai cocktail pairing, or tea pairing. I chose the cocktail pairing and my wife chose the tea pairing.  

Once it neared our reservation time, we were escorted through the salon to the main dining space for Ōre.  The resturant has 6 seats and our 2nd seating that evening had 5 diners.  The space is minimalistic, bright and open.  White colors on the diner side are seperated by the large wooden counter from the industrial kitchen area.  We spoke with the beverage manager and confirmed our drink pairings that we determined earlier.  

Ōre is carefully timed, as our evening was 33 courses paired with 6 drinks, and our courses began to flow 5 minutes into our reservation time. 

From here, we were constantly presented with food courses and drinks, each with a staff member explaining what we had in front of us.  

The staff made an effort to explain less common ingredients they chose to use, why they were selected and how it was prepared.
We found this information to be clearly presented, valuable to the context of the chef's process, and important because it spaced our dishes out.  Each dish was typically presented and cleared within 3-4 minutes.  The courses were usually 1-4 bites. We never felt rushed between courses.

Counter resturant dining is not the best place to have a deep conversation with your party.  The kitchen is open and an  entertainment of itself.  There is constant motion, preparations, explanations, plating, and eating to occupy the time.

After 27 courses, all diners are asked to join the staff in a separate area across the salon. This dining space is soft and black in contrast to the hard and white area prior. You are seated at party specific tables at this point, still with a complete view of the new kitchen.

These 6 courses fly by and you are presented a 'book of Ōre'.  It details the development of the resturant and menu with illustrations and the chef's insights.  You cannot take it home but you can take pictures!

At this point your meal is finished and the parting gift was a chocolate muffin and a hand written menu of your meal that day.  The menu changes every day in course number and course variety.

Overall:  Ōre deserves its recommendation from the Michelin guide.  Service was great.  Food was great!  I would 100% dine there again.  
I can see why it did not receive a star though. The beverage pairings were nice but it is not the resturant's priority presently.  25-35 courses a seating is ambitious. Pairing to that much variety is nearly impossible.  The thai cocktail pairing was perfect for 1 out of every 5-6 courses and a similar ratio for the tea pairing.  The drinks were fine for the other courses but not enhancing the food with every sip, most courses. These pairings are a unique offering and allowed both of us to explore new and exciting flavors.  A superior champagne or white wine may be a better path for a more sophisticated diner.

Ore is great now and based on their 'book of Ōre;' still developing new and exciting courses.

1. They will not honor your reservation time and make you wait a hour plus the time you reserved for. They give you champagne and empanadas while waiting in this huge crowd but to be honest after a while it just feels chaotic.

2. The food is so mediocre I have no clue how they have a Michelin star. I forget the cut of meats we ordered cuz I was so annoyed but it tasted so chewy and forgettable. I was exited to try the sweetbread, which cost $80 USD, and it tasted like nothing.

We had better steak, sweetbread and sides for a fraction of the cost at Hierro in Palermo.
I thought this would be similar to an experience like Cote in terms of food quality but absolutely not.

1735892161.0,New York City recs + question,"I’m planning for a two-adult NYC trip in late April and a bit overwhelmed in planning for dinners; I’ve spent ages looking at the Michelin site but would love first-hand advice from the folks here.

Some background below, but the TL;DR is that I’m looking for non-seafood centric restaurant suggestions that can be dined at by two for (roughly) under ~$1000 and ~$500 total costs (not necessarily including alcohol). New American and French preferred but not exclusively. Debating whether Per Se is worth it.

Details for folks who feel like diving in…

Dietary restrictions and preferences: Ironically and/or conveniently, one of us is pescatarian and the other is an omnivore who strongly dislikes most seafood. (For the record, we have done a few tasting menus where I’ll get the vegetarian menu, he’ll get the regular menu, and we’ll just switch plates if any seafood dishes aren’t to his liking. However, we do tend to avoid restaurants where the tasting menus lean heavily toward seafood.) 

Cuisine preferences: He isn’t a huge fan yet of most Asian or Middle Eastern cuisines, unfortunately. We will definitely go to Asian and Middle Eastern restaurants, but it’s not where we want to spend the biggest $ right now.

Budget: We’re looking to ideally do three fine dining nights. The budget for one night is ~$1000 total, for the other two nights is ~$500 total per night. We do drink and enjoy wine pairings but don’t consider them essential, so it’s OK if those prices are exclusive of alcohol.

Restaurants we’ve particularly enjoyed: Oriole and Sepia in Chicago, Little Pearl and Rooster & Owl in DC. I went to The French Laundry about 15 years ago, which leads me to the question I have beyond general recommendations matching the above…

Should we consider Per Se for our “bigger” night? My partner has never been to a Thomas Keller restaurant nor to a Michelin 3-star in general, so I’m considering it for that reason (and am OK pushing our budget some to accommodate if it’s the best pick). My experience at TFL was absolutely spectacular — like a “fine dining rite of passage” experience — but admittedly was a long time ago. 

Our biggest priority is memorably delicious rather than out-of-this-world unique, but I don’t want to pick Per Se just based on name recognition and miss out on something better I may not be aware of.

1. Herb/flower rice paper and tomato water. Rice paper came in an envelope. A bit of herbaceousness, but mostly flavorless but interesting. Tomato water was pure sweet cherry tomato. I don't know what it is with Argentina, but every tomato we had everywhere (even pretty crappy places) was ripe, sweet, and delicious. This was a pure distillation of that

2) Hazelnut peach, Enoki tarts. I'll be frank, I remember enjoying the hazelnut peach, but couldn't tell you a thing about it other than it had those flavors. The enoki tarts were brilliant, though - earthy and creamy. The tart shell was precise - just the right thickness and texture to compliment the mushroom without overwhelming it. Great dish.

3) King crab, Ocean foam. The king crab legs were remarkable - the shell isn't real shell, but a made thing that apparently takes 3 days to create. Pure flavor of crab in these - cool to look at and a huge hit if you're a crab-fan. The Ocean foam has an airy, crisp, shrimp foam around a creamy fish (I think trout) filling. My daughter took a skeptical bite, her eyes popped open and she shoved the rest in her mouth. A delicious flavor and texture combination we all really enjoyed.

4), Brioche/trout/caviar, razor clams & oysters. Who doesn't love caviar? This first part was delicious and satisfying - perhaps a bit more brioche than I would find ideal but an easy and winning dish, again contrasting textures and complimenting flavors that worked brilliantly. The razor clams and oysters in a cream sauce with smoked or charcoal infused oil was completely incredible, though. The clams were so fresh, cut perfectly to retain the texture and bite of clam but integrating with the cream sauce beautifully. This would have been our favorite dish if not for the rockfish to come...

5) Tenderloin and kimchi taco in a nori shell.  Just look at it - the beef was rare and exquisitely fat-veined and tender. Not a hint of toughness or connective tissue. You can probably guess how this tasted. It was delicious.

https://preview.redd.it/6d3enuwggeae1.jpg?width=3640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b43baabb9372a9aee188e889b5442a087c582901

6) Scallops, trout roe, in a sort of almond cream thing, dusted with some sort of beet powder. None of us love beets, none of us loved this dish. Fine but not great. I felt like the scallop sweetness and flavor were lost in the rest of the dish.

https://preview.redd.it/htlhyzwggeae1.jpg?width=4080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6b87ca2a75f4b8027fe27f51c887c4f9d9aaee37

7) Rockfish. OMG this rockfish. Everyone loved it. The only fish I can remember having that I enjoyed anywhere near this much was at Oriole served in a fermented rice with a grated rice over top of it which smelled like popcorn. I wish I had a better idea of what they put in this sauce because it perfectly accentuated the perfectly cooked and seasoned fish without overwhelming or clashing with it (with apologies to le Bernardin who don't do this nearly as well). Peas? Clams? I guess they were in there but it was so much more. In a night with almost nothing but great dishes, this was the star.

8) Pork in a passionfruit and saffron sauce. I know it sounds weird. It was delicious. A really unexpected but tasty flavor combination. I wish I could express it better. This was hard to describe but very enjoyable.

https://preview.redd.it/wcli1wwggeae1.jpg?width=3635&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=934e1d142d3ac3d2c92757f5a413cbe80dd2e4ef

8) Sweetbread in a cereza sauce. Sweetbreads can be tough for some people because of the texture and because some folk just don't like the idea of offal. My wife is one of those people. She put the idea in my daughter's head as well. As a result, I got to eat 3 of these. Crispy on the outside, with the cereza sauce tasting a bit like like the best barbeque sauce I've ever had. This dish was exquisite and I loved every bite of it. My daughter later ate some sweetbreads at another tasting we had a couple weeks later and LOVED them. She hasn't forgiven her mother for scaring her out of trying it here yet.

9) Duck. It's duck, it was perfectly cooked. About what you'd expect. Every bit as delicious as the Chef's Table at the Brooklyn Fare under Cesar if you've had it. Winning dish, but not as interesting or surprising as some of the others.

https://preview.redd.it/cww8fxwggeae1.jpg?width=4080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=419f1e91f14b376029251d3e900991c1a62294fd

10) Desserts - I'm not going to go into these in detail. They taste about as they look and were all delicious (particularly the faux avocado with mango filling).

Wine pairings are listed. I'm not well educated on Argentinian wines, but I am now a fan of them. These were really well selected to go with the dishes.  The saki was good, but I don't know if it really worked well with the tenderloin. I think I also found the Gewurztraminer with the scallops to be odd, likely because it didn't go with the beets.

Overall, sensational meal. Definitely recommended. Will eat there again if we find ourselves in BA again.

EDIT: forgot to mention - for the gluten sensitive and celiacs, they were extremely accommodating and provided excellent substitution ingredients to ensure safety.

1735682273.0,"SingleThread (***) - Healdsburg, CA","We stayed a couple of nights at SingleThread for a year-end trip, wanted to do the full experience (inn stay + shabu + dinner), and what an experience it was. The hospitality is beyond incredible, the staff are amazing, friendly and accommodating, and you’re taken care of from start to finish. I have even more pictures of other aspects of the Inn stay but hit the upload limit lol. 

Dinner at the restaurant was phenomenal. I saw some comments before saying the Japanese breakfast is even better but I didn’t find that to be the case for my taste, not to say the breakfast wasn’t delicious as well. That salmon is to die for. The in-room shabu donabe dinner is very mild and all about highlighting the ingredients. It’s definitely veggie heavy so if your party is made up of primarily meat eaters or have a heavy palate, I would skip. It is also a full service meal where someone will be in and out serving each course etc.

The 10-course tasting menu:

1. Early Winter In Sonoma—small bites, there were so many starting with a shigoku oyster, various sashimi, sesame tofu, and 3 warm bites of SB uni chawanmushi, cod, and another fish I forgot the name of

2. Sawara, hibiscus, kanpyo, pomegranate, bone tare

3. Aka amadai with crispy scales, cauliflower dashi, wasabina, yuba, preserved lemon

4. Duck liver parfait salad with black apple, brown butter, salanova lettuce

5. Hokkaido scallop katsu-inspired lightly fried in nori with malted candy roaster, Petaluma chanterelle, Burgundy truffle, caramelized scallop jus

6. Buddha’s hand, Preston olive oil, black tea and Douglas fir jellies

7. Duclair duck & Miyazaki A5 wagyu ($90 supplement), trio of cabbage, roasted garlic-miso sabayon, farm prune preserves

8. Luna koshikari porridge shime with wagyu short rib, smoked American chestnut, Piracicaba broccoli

9. Sunchoke & cacao, Lydgate Farms vanilla, buttermilk, brownie

10. Wagashi of Meyer lemon verjus blanc in a white chocolate eggshell, Kintoki carrot frozen custard and mokum tops, mochi and miso, and eggnog and mace

Take-home is a packet of komatsuna seeds (traditional Japanese leafy green vegetable)

We chose not to do the wine pairing and instead opted for sake since I saw they have a sake subscription program. The sommelier, Matt, chose two wonderful picks based on our request.

Inn breakfasts with a la carte options:

Sonoma breakfast—chanterelle and honeynut squash poached egg, pomme rosti with black truffle and creme fraiche (bougie tots are bomb), house-made Cumberland sausage, beet and goat cheese salad, crumpet with butter and jam

Japanese breakfast—miso grilled salmon, Luna rice with pumpkin and habanada pepper, broccolini goma dare, spicy glazed kabocha, dashimaki tamago, tsukemono, yudofu miso soup with Ohitashi farm greens

Addons:

1. Black trumpet mushroom omelette with negi  and goma

2. Japanese souffle pancakes with apple compote and whipped cream

3. Fuyu persimmon toast with ricotta, citrus, pecan

4. Journeyman Meats barrel-smoked bacon

You can choose one of the set meals and add on any other items if you wish, including fresh orange juice, smoothie, coffee and tea. 

Shabu:

1. Started off with miniature version of dinner’s first course—grilled shima aji(?) collar, mini tuna taco in a nori and nasturtium shell, chanterelle tempura, yuba and fuyu persimmon, cured salmon

2. Kinmedai with Kintoki carrots & other farm vegetables

3. Wagyu beef, assortment of vegetables from their farm, myoga, celtuce

4. Fuyu persimmon sticky toffee pudding and a burnt orange custard

All of their meals feature primarily ST grown produce or ultra-locally sourced products from other farms. 

Some quick Inn info: I think they have activities at their Farm just down the road if you ask/plan ahead of time but we wanted to explore the area on our own. We did stop by the Farm and they let us walk around on our own. Audi Q4 and Q8 e-trons available to reserve for use and great for visiting nearby wineries. Complimentary room service of half-dozen oysters, charcuterie, cheese, crudités, and matcha or espresso affogato. Additional charge for caviar and champagne.

1735660309.0,Capital One Landing by José Andrés Group,"Perhaps this is an unconventional contribution to this community, but my wife and I “dined” at the recently opened Capital One Landing lounge at Reagan National Airport in DC. The “landing” concept is more of a restaurant style than a traditional airport lounge, and the tapas menu here was developed in collaboration with José Andrés Group.

Overall, this was the best airport dining experience I’ve had. The food was exceptional, the cocktails were well crafted, and the service was as good as you can expect from a US airport lounge. My only note of improvement would be the wine selection, but I suppose you can only ask for so much when everything is free. 

I can’t recommend this spot enough. It’s obviously not on the caliber of most everything else posted in this sub, but they are doing something radically different and refreshing compared to every other airport lounge. We loved it!

1735657891.0,Why I’m booked for a second visit to Plenitude,"I ate at Plenitude in February 2024 after seeing Alexander the Guest’s YouTube review. I was captivated. I emailed them in the Summer 2023 and snapped up the next available table for one eight / nine months away. I love Paris and Reims. These cities have been my preferred destinations to rest and recharge since travel reopened in April 2022. I love exploring new cities and restaurants, but there is nothing more restorative than seeing a familiar face in a beautiful setting. L’Assiette Champenoise in Reims holds a special place in my heart for this reason. So any reason to go to France is good enough. 

The first experience at Plenitude was sublime. The setting was beautiful, the staff were warm and friendly, and the food was beyond my description. The sauces alone were worth the trip. It really was as good as it seems. I have an older post with photos of the food. 

Lying in bed a few weeks ago, I had a similar realization to one I had with champagne: There are no rules. If you want to have champagne as a table wine, you can. It’s not obligatory to wait for an anniversary, holiday, or birthday. The same goes with dining: *There is no rule saying you must try new restaurants at every opportunity.* I am allowed to go back to a place I’ve enjoyed. It’s my money and time, and I’m in no rush to collect new experiences just for the sake of variety.  I considered le Cinq, but for sheer enjoyment, warmth, relaxation, and being in the moment, I’d rather go back to Plenitude. I could have researched all the restaurants in Paris, Reims, and Lyon, evaluated each for what would be optimal or most interesting. I could have gone for more Michelin stars to wave in front of those friends who also count their stars. 

I emailed Plenitude that morning, asking for a table for one for the evening of Thanksgiving 2025.I know that the experience will be great. It’s exciting. It’s something I get to look forward to for a year that won’t be a disappointment after.

I'm returning to Hokkaido again w/ cousins for the Snow Festival and want some recommendations (already have almost all of it planned out except for the fine dining one which I'm still torn about but am worried I need to reserve asap)

E.g. Shimoyamitenae Izuru, Sushi Arima, Sushi Kura, Sushi Miyakawa etc

I hear Moliere pop up, and not exactly opposed but curious why go there vs an actual japanese (or at least fusion) restaurant (only 2nd time in Hokkaido, and I prolly wont b coming back too often)

Also, is fine dining sushi in Japan also worth it? Honestly, in my home country (PH in SEA), the $200-$400 sushi Omakases I've tried were just extremely disappointing (I mean, it was good but not for the price esp vs their Ala Carte menu)

So at this moment, not sure if it's something I'll appreciate (tho Japanese is one of my favorite cuisines, I'm just not sure if it's 'worth it'), especially when I was in Hokkaido last year the wet markets were already really good and it was the more expensive restaurants that disappointed me a bit (granted it was Hyosetsu no Mon and Wagyu Ishizaki, so not rly sushi spots)

Any advice, perhaps? :D

1735612773.0,"Victoria and Albert’s (*) - Orlando, FL ","I’ve had the pleasure of dining at Victoria and Albert’s twice (about 3 months apart)

Ambiance: You forget you’re on Disney property. It’s a whole other world once you enter the dining room. The live harp player is also excellent and she takes requests. 

Service: Quality and knowledge were there, occasionally though could come off as a bit sterile. They’re going for a very formal dining room which can on occasion feel stiff. I think it’s less noticeable when you’re dining with others. 

Price: There are three menu options, 9 courses, 11 courses and a chefs tasting menu. The main dining room allows you to select from either the 9 or 11 course menu. The chefs table is a separate menu exclusive to the small room. For this experience you’re starting at about $400-$600pp with drinks and tips included. 

Food:
Overall the menu was very enjoyable. There was very few things I didn’t enjoy. However I feel that they played it very safe in terms of flavors. My second dining experience didn’t change much from my first, at most a dish or some ingredients changed. I can see though that it is somewhat by design. They’re trying to make a truly special dining experience for those who might be less versed in fine dining and may not enjoy being as adventurous. Flavors were excellent, preparations superb so no complaints there.

I did feel like the pastry program was lacking a little, for a restaurant of this caliber I expected more to wrap up the meal. Overall still had an excellent experience. 

Favorites:
All of the canapés
- Iberico, plum, shallot Norwegian pancake it was savory and buttery. 
- Sweet Pea and white chocolate was surprising and slightly palette cleansing 
- Kingfish was light and fun and refreshing with the yuzu sauce.

- This was served in a “movie popcorn” sauce. It was super super buttery and rich, which is why the raspberry really helped cut through. It was unexpectedly good. 
- Apparently this one was a staff favorite

Koji aged quail, sunflower “risotto”and sunchokes 
- The puffed sunflower to make a risotto was surprising. It was nutty and complex. The quail was superb savory and not gamey.

Boar Tenderloin and Boar Sausage
- Super good the tenderloin was phenomenal, they kept it simple and let the food speak for itself with a very simple broccolini 
- The sausage was spicy, loved the multiple preparations.

A5 Waygu 
- I don’t really need to say more 
- They served it with short grain rice in a broth with chanterelle and furikake, umami bomb could be used to describe this whole course. 

Mango Pavlova, Serrano and Chantilly 
- I really like mango pavlova, the Serrano added complexity. Not overly spicy but definitely tamed some of the sweetness",finedining
1735604022.0,The Modern (Lunch)  ,"Took me forever to make it here but and it ended up making my top few meals of the year honestly. . Had the 7 course lunch, with multiple dishes being some of my favorites of the year . Service, views, and food were all top notch, with a little extra wine poured and a perfectly timed additional second brioche toast with the Eggs on eggs on eggs dish.  Sadly not pictured , the hot chocolate which i just downed too quickly (one of the best)

for the (high for lunch )price all the food felt properly elevated and delicious . only semi miss is the third photo of the citrus hiramasa, marinated with horseradish, wild sorrel and avocado. Next time we’ll be back for the Kitchen Table.

one: actually forgot what this was exactly but perfect starter soup 

two: eggs on eggs on eggs. the modern staple, and rightfully so. a divine combination of ingredients and conceptually outstanding too.

three:  hiramasa and avocado as mentioned above 

four: diver scallop and squid, cabbage braised with toasted nori

five: duck with citrus and some incredible purée i forgot (ugh no menu) but this was perfect.

six:  venison, glazed with cognac, chili and arugula pesto , impressed with these back to back red meats that both felt like they flowed together and wasn’t overkill. both outstanding. 

seven : apple pie with cream and ice cream.

not pictured : hot chocolate which id return for explicitly 😂 maybe it was just the weather .",finedining
1735594898.0,Sushi in Tokyo,"I'm planning a trip to Tokyo in Feb/March 2025 and am looking to have an intimate sushi experience to celebrate a significant accomplishment. As a sushi novice, I'm a bit overwhelmed by the sheer quantity of fine dining sushi restaurants and want to better understand what to expect when I decide where I will be making a reservation.

I've been doing some research and understand there are different levels like:

* High-End: Michelin-starred, exclusive, highly regarded chefs.
* Mid-Range: Upscale, known for quality, may offer some English options.
* Casual: More relaxed, may offer a la carte options.

**For those who have experienced High-End and Mid-Range levels of sushi dining in Japan, can you share your insights?**

* What are the key differences to expect in terms of:
   * Food quality & presentation:
   * Service & atmosphere:
   * Price point & value:
   * Overall dining experience:
* What are some things to look out for or be aware of at each level?
* For a first-timer, what level would you recommend to start with and why?

I'm eager to learn and have a memorable sushi experience during my trip. Any guidance that could help me choose from the seemingly endless options will be greatly appreciated.",finedining
1735594451.0,Cyrus (*) - Phenomenal meal that rivals SF Bay area’s best,"I was surprisingly blown away but how good Cyrus was.

For context - I’ve been to SingleThread, Saison, and Quince all this year. 

Cyrus was the best from start to finish.

Not only was it innovative, but it was also very flavorful and complex.

The dishes that stood out (which was most of them)

- Black Truffle Chicken in Egg Custard. Truffles can be executed with a very high ceiling, but also can be really bland. This was exceptional and well-balanced

- Foie Gras “Oreo” with Puma Orchards Apple Butter. Exactly what it sounds like. Amazing

- A5 Waygu with Beef Broth.  A5 is another one that can be hit or miss. Often times they don’t get the crust quite right, but this had such a lovely, flakey crust and it was perfectly cooked inside. The broth I forgot to frame in the picture but it was dark brown with such a powerful, yet elegantly balanced beef flavor. Definitely one of the best dishes I’ve had at any restaurant this year.

- Nantucket Bay Sweet Scallops with Sunchoke & Mashed Potato & Black Sesame Miso

- Sonoma Duck a la Four Seasons, Purple Cabbage, Freekeh

- Braised Pork, Parsnip Creamed Spinach, Parmesan Miso ""Gremolata"" topped with White Alba Truffles. 

- Époisses Buñuelo, Hoshigaki, Balsamic

- Apples with Brown Butter Custard and Celery Root

Not to mention, the environment/atmosphere was really cool and modern without coming off as pretentious.

You can tell the head chef really cares and wants you to have a good experience.

If you haven’t been, go! Cyrus is firing on all cylinders right now. ",finedining

The cocktails were also fantastic, which too many places seem to ignore. By places, I’ll put Alinea at the top of that list. 

We also got a slice at Bambino’s and hit the pub after, sang holiday songs with a pint and with folks from all over and awesome Irish people. All-in-all a great Dublin evening. ",finedining

Just wanted to do an interest check to see if anyone wanted to join a fine dining discord I made.

It's a newer discord channel, very casual setting. We post detailed reviews, talk about random things in the fine dining world and home cooking, and get one another's opinions on different spots. We've also done a few meetups with people creating their own meetups in their regions, i.e. San Francisco, Texas, Europe, etc.

1735534841.0,Copine - Seattle,"We had dinner at [Copine](https://www.copineseattle.com/) while visiting Seattle. It’s a 3 course prix fixe menu. We did not opt for the additional middle course  and we both ordered the exact same dishes so no idea what all else we missed.

Amuse bouch was a cauliflower panna cotta served with a puff pastry. Very light cauliflower flavor, nice and refreshing.

The potato vichyssoise seemed like the obvious choice given the weather. I found it lacking in flavor. I was expecting more character from the leak but mostly got cream. The soup was saved by the addition of Brussels sprouts and bacon which carried all the flavor.

The tenderloin rossini was served on a potato rosti with a foie gras medallion on top. This was the highlight of the evening for both of us. Perfectly cooked beef with the added richness of the foie gras was just sublime. 

We got the cheese plate for dessert. A nice slab of blue cheese (Bleu d'Auvergne) next to a molasses cookie topped with apricot mostrada. The cheese was great but I didn’t find that the rest of the dish added all that much. I had a glass of the 2016 Chateau Guiraud which paired very nicely with the cheese (just the right amount of sweetness compared to the much sweeter apricot).

Overall, a very pleasant evening. The entree alone was worth the price of admission. My lesson about fine dining this time: don’t be boring and try some different options.",finedining

1735464751.0,"Heft, High Newton in the UK (1*)","We went to Heft last night in Cumbria, UK. This was a great menu focused on highlighting seasonal vegetables with a good amount of protein. 

Highlights included a dish called Onion, Onion, Onion, Mint which included various preparations of onion and a mint dashi. A lovely palate cleanser after amuse bouches and you almost wish more places did this kind of thing. 

A fantastic mistake, glazed in zoy with a brilliant dittander and guanicale. The pork fat on top was excellent and it was a surprisingly meaty dish. 

There was a fantastic sea bream dish, smoked to perfection with a mind-blowingly good Amelia tomato sauce and their own kimchi.

Monkfish follows in a traditional English curry style sauce, scorched lightly with mussels cooked in their own liquor and ""chip shop scraps"".

Venison was served cooked over embers with the most incredible sauce ever. Perhaps the single best cooked bit of meat I have ever eaten. 

Desserts were all thoughtfully well executed. A lovely palate cleanser of compotes, brown butter and some type of very light moose followed by a fun dish called ""When Daisy met Bramble"", a floral ice cream on top of fruit compote, shaved fudge and spices. This was delicious. a third and final dessert arrived of some sort of choux piped with maple, a light nutty cream, hazelnut. 

This was a lovely night out and we had absolutely no complaints. I'd fully recommend it anyone in the area! ",finedining

It’s not fancy by any means, it’s chaotic, loud, busy, and definitely a bit overwhelming, but the food is fantastic and the vibe is really fun. Definitely surpassed my expectations!A few highlights:

* Of course, the ceviches are fantastic. We got 3 different ones and my favorite was the uni ceviche (I can’t imagine how much it would cost if it weren’t in Peru)

* All of their raw seafood was phenomenal, we had their scallops and their Peruvian poke bowl, everything is super fresh and light

* The pescado a la brasa was unreal — just simply cooked on the grill, a beautiful sauce, and this dish was gone very quickly 

I would say that it is best to come to La Mar with a group of people (we were there with 4 people) because you’ll want to get a lot of food and a lot of it is meant for sharing so you can try a lot of different menu items. It’s not a tasting menu or anything super fancy, but it’s a great time with great food and a lot of local Peruvians also love going there even though it’s become a hit with tourists as well 🤩

1735400789.0,Turk Fatih Tutak ** Istanbul,"Faith Fatih Tutak is an exceptional dining experience in Istanbul, lasting approximately three hours. The evening begins in the lounge with appetizers and champagne, setting the stage for a luxurious journey. You are then escorted to the dining room, where a full tasting menu unfolds, showcasing exquisite flavors and meticulous presentation.  

One of the unique highlights is how the experience concludes: after the meal, guests are taken into the kitchen for dessert and a behind-the-scenes tour. This personal touch adds a memorable layer to an already extraordinary evening.  

While the food was outstanding, I found the menu to be a bit too rich for my taste; I couldn’t finish the last two courses as it was simply too much. Additionally, one aspect of the service left me surprised: the champagne offered at the beginning felt complimentary but was added to the bill without prior clarification. (Around 1,500TL) My suggestion would be to either incorporate it into the tasting menu price or make it optional.  Most tasting menus I’ve done in my life that started with a cocktail, was included in the price. 

Overall, Faith Fatih Tutak is an excellent restaurant that stands out in Istanbul’s dining scene. If you’re in the city, I highly recommend booking a table here (in advance! I had to call the concierge at Peninsula everyday to secure a last minute table!).

1735395373.0,"Meza Malonga - Kigali, Rwanda","
I travel to Africa every year and sometimes find it hard to find “fine dining experiences”. Kigali has long been on my bucket list, for gorilla trekking, and let me tell you how surprised I got with my unforgettable at Meza Malonga. Thanks to an extraordinary dining experience at Meza Malonga a restaurant that redefined my understanding of African cuisine.  

Chef Dieuveil Malonga, a visionary chef celebrated for his innovative approach to African gastronomy. Hailing from Congo and shaped by experiences in Europe, Malonga infuses his dishes with influences from across the African continent. His cooking reflects a deep respect for tradition while embracing contemporary techniques and presentation.  

Chef Malonga has received notable mentions in the World’s 50 Best Restaurants, a testament to his talent and dedication. As I savored every dish, I couldn’t help but feel that if Michelin ever extends its guide to Africa, Meza Malonga would easily earn one, if not two, stars.⭐️⭐️

The concept at Meza Malonga revolves around showcasing the rich diversity of African ingredients, spices, and culinary traditions. Each dish tells a story, weaving flavors and techniques from countries like Rwanda, Congo, Morocco, and Senegal. The tasting menu, which changes with the seasons, is a journey through Africa’s vibrant culinary landscape.  

I’ve had the privilege of dining at some of the finest establishments worldwide, Meza Malonga now holds a place in my Top 10, possibly even my Top 5, of the best dining experiences I’ve ever had. From 3* establishments and From North America, to Europe, to Asia, I can say this was one of the best dining experiences I’ve ever had. This chef will put Africa on the map in terms of complexity in each dish. 


If you’re planning a trip to Kigali, I cannot recommend Meza Malonga enough. It’s not just a meal—it’s a celebration of Africa’s culinary heritage and an unforgettable journey for your taste buds. For me, it was the perfect way to round off an adventure that began with gorilla trekking and ended with a feast that felt like a true homecoming to the heart of Africa.  ",finedining

First time I’ve been to a 2 star and also this is the most I’ve ever paid for a meal. It was delicious but not sure if worth the price? There were some high end things on the menu and the wines were very nice. Let’s see if I remember everything 😅

1-4: started with some bites and champagne and the bread which is the only thing I didn’t get a picture of. The bread was fabulous with 3 different flavored butters, yuzu, buckwheat and caramelised onion. Bites were in order: hummus with crackers, Dutch cheese with pickles, scallop and then (king?) crab. My fave was the scallop as it just melted. 

5: oyster and caviar with cucumber. The cucumber was so intensely concentrated. Brilliant little dish. 

6: lobster with radish. This had a delicately bitter flavor profile and matched with a sweet Mosel Riesling which was very nice. My partner wasn’t a huge fan of this cos he is not into bitter flavors too much. I thought it was clever to match with the butteriness of the lobster. 

7: I think this was swordfish with brown butter sauce. This was tasty but not exceptional. 

8: another white fish with buttery sauce/foam. I think the fish was skate but don’t quote me. Also nice but not exceptional 

9: duck stuffed with …can’t remember. A bread stuffing and a cherry sauce. This was great. 

10: A5 Wagyu beef Wellington. The standout dish of the night. I’m showing my low class here by not having tried Wagyu before this. It was insanely good and so soft. The mushroom and the pastry was very delicate and a nice addition of truffles. Loved this. 

11: the “cheese course” I think was Brie with something else. It was nice but not exceptional. 

12: rum baba for dessert. This was assembled at the table. I liked the flavors but it didn’t feel like an overly technical dish. 

The staff and service was excellent - could not fault them. We got a panettone to take home which I gave to my MIL so I can’t tell you if it was good or not. It was nice to do something special for Xmas. ",finedining

Every dish was a masterclass in innovation, sustainability, and artistry, reflecting Germany’s natural bounty. Combined with their legendary wine pairings, it’s a dining experience I’ll never forget.

The total price was a shock because I had accident agreed to a 200 euro glass of champagne- I am not fancy enough to appreciate paying such an insane amount.

1735380203.0,"Grace & Savour (*) - West Midlands, UK","Such a beautiful find at a surprising midlands location in the UK. Grace & Savour is based at Hampton Manor and is set amongst the manors old walled garden that has been completely brought back to life with a huge focus on produce quality, rare varieties, flavour and sustainability. 

The head chef, David, offers a tour of the garden if you’re staying overnight and really sets the stage for the meal with an outpouring of passion for soil health and all things agriculture that feature throughout the tasting menu. 

Lovely minimal decor within the restaurant looks over the garden and open kitchen and it makes for a super relaxing theatre stage style service. On the point of service, dishes were brought by kitchen and front of house team members throughout and they had so much to say about the produce. This was a joy to hear and they clearly have been on many visits to local farms, they hold the passion for the ethos David laid out clearly around sustainability and farming practices. 

Absolute stand out dishes for me included: 3, 4, 5, 6, 11. 

I wouldn’t have felt like I’d missed out if the meal didn’t include: 2, 10. 

Overall, I found the meal delicious, enjoyable and educational in the least overbearing or preachy way possible. I’d be surprised if this restaurant doesn’t receive a second star or at least a green star. 

(1) A broth of roasted duck bones with organic peas, Scottish girolle and Sea buckthorn from the Cornish coast.
/ No pic unfortunately, I was far too carried away talking! 

(2) Biodynamic cucumber from Toby with aubergine and our bread miso finished with sunflower and cucumber petals from our garden. 

(3) A tart of Chapel Organic beetroot with lacto-fermented beetroot honey and biodynamic yoghurt from Loch Arthur Creamery. 
/ stand out bite for me, I loved the beetroot and yogurt flavour so much. 

(4) Tartar of Dunwood Farm's Wagyu sirloin with black garlic, pickled elderflower and a salad of nasturtiums, watercress and lacto-fermented wild garlic. 
/ indulgent umami goodness with an unexpected pickled elderflower element cutting through. 

(5) Organic field mushroom with toasted buckwheat and Welsh black truffle. 
/ again, an intense umami hit. Nothing unexpected but very delicious. 

(6) Razor clams with sea herbs from the Cornish Coast, cobnuts from Billy with a broth made from apple, mussels and sea pepper oil.
/ did not expect to like this as much as I did, really wonderful and fresh flavours.

(7) Seeded sourdough bread made by Adam, our in-house baker, served with butter infused with the same grain the bread is made with. 

(8) Cornish Scallops hand dived by Frazer with sweetcorn from our garden, chilli peppers from Toby and dried scallop roe. 

(9) Cornish line caught wild seabass with a sauce of the smoked bones, kohlrabi and preserved gooseberry and fig of last year. 
/ serving the sea bass with the sweet, acidic preserves was a triumph choice. 

(10) Duck from Worcester duck famn with duck faggot, pickled beach rose, agastache and mexican marigolds from our garden. 
/ tasty sure, but for the main course this felt a little familiar or maybe I’m just not a huge duck fan. 

(11) Organic blueberries from Trehane nurseries with toasted marshmallow, lavender and buttermilk. 
/ toasted marshmallow flavour was so unexpected but made for a lovely pre dessert. 

(12) A parfait of honey from Maggie in Knowle, with biodynamic redcurrants from Toby at Four Acres Farm and crème fraiche sorbet. 

(13) Chobnut Financier with Crème Fraiche and berry compote",finedining
1735373952.0,"Sushi Shikon, Hong Kong","My first 3 star sushi. The apps were incredible. Standout apps were ankimo served with liver, octopus, and shiromi served two ways (one with a citrus juice and zest, one with special soy sauce and wasabi). All the fish was unbelievably tender and flavorful. I revisited the Mackerel Roll it was so unique in flavor and texture- served with a special ginger and shiso leaf. Rice was well seasoned. 

They did a great job with temperature of all the food. They even asked me to wait until a course was served when they saw me going to the bathroom. Staff to client ratio is high and they are pretty well coordinated. Sushi chef was well engaged and shared lots of information about the food preparation and technique. 

My only gripe is tea was too hot, which I told them but then they served it too cool/lukewarm. Very expensive but would recommend if you’re ok with a splurge. I was a bit hesitant because I assume you can get pretty great sushi in Hong Kong at very reasonable price points. ",finedining

1735362446.0,Altura - Seattle (Christmas eve),"Went to Altura for Christmas eve and had a great experience. I’m not an experienced Fine Diner so this is written from a somewhat naive point of view.

We sat at the chef’s counter so had a bit of a view into food preparation but not much more.  The counter sits around 8 people and we were at the edge so a bit out of the action. Overall the staff was very welcoming and make sure we were happy throughout.

There were several time during the meal when I said “this is the best X I’ve ever had”. The first was the savory cannoli that came with the second course. I can’t even describe the full mix of flavors except to say that I would have enjoyed a bowlful. The mussels and the octopus (which puts Shaker + Spear to shame) made for a sublime mix of texture and flavor. Then the pumpkin stuffed pasta and then the bread slice that seemed to defy physics with how springy it was.

We watched the full 20 some plates of entree being constructed in front of us, item by item, with 4 of the chefs involved in the procession. It was quite a show. Surprisingly, this was the most disappointing item for me. The charred elk was cooked to perfection but served with truffles and a charred cabbage leaf (I think that’s what it was) and it often made for strong combination of unpleasantly bitter flavor. The (optional) wagyu definitely helped rescue that course.

After the entree came the brodo (broth) course which I will now require to have with every meal, followed by dessert. I wasn’t wowed by the dessert. The persimmon creamsicle was tasty, the chocolate “affogato” was good (too small to fully enjoy), and the rum baba was heavily drenched in rum.

Overall, a very enjoyable evening. I’m a bit torn about the tasting menu concept. I enjoyed trying various things but often found myself wanting to enjoy some item for longer than I could.

1735355459.0,"Sud 777 - Stay Away, Don’t Book ","I dined at Sud 777 solo and was excited by the photos other reviewers posted and the recommendation by other redditors to dine here. 

This is by far the worst restaurant I’ve had the pleasure of dining at. No idea how it gained a Michelin star. From this experience, I will now sort by 1 star reviews on Google before booking - a I unfortunately had a similar experience to other patrons who found this experience lacking flavor and missing the price point. Looking at the recent ones and Reddit’s suggestions for fine dining in the city, I thought I was safe.

First off, there were 8 out of 13 dishes served raw or partially cooked. Not raw as in something fun like beef or fish - but raw vegetables and fruits. There was little cooking in this meal and little cohesion of flavors. Many courses had no salt, and others tried too hard to use savory and sweet as pairings. Cheap chocolate and an anchovy smaller than my pinky counted as one course. The raw tomato, raw tangerine with fish roe, partially cooked bok choy, and raw cabbage left much to be desired.

Apparently there’s an a la carte menu the staff will not present you if you’re a foreigner, and that’s where all of the good dishes are. I was only offered the tasting menu of basically raw vegetables and poor pairings. 

I do not recommend booking, and if you do it might be the worst tasting and worst value menu you’ll have.

Pictured is the tomato slice with vanilla oil. Just tasted like a raw tomato with no salt.",finedining

Went here on my sister's recommendation. It's her favorite restaurant in DC. Overall I thought the food was great, but nothing had that wow factor, there's no standout dish that I will be thinking about later. Fun environment but at times felt like they were trying a little too hard to be trendy. The menu is set up so that you have options for you three courses to pick from as well as a few preset ""gifts"" in between course including the beggars purses and the taste the rainbow sorbet. My date and I ordered different things for each course so that we were able to try almost the entire menu (there were only two options for the first two courses but three for the third course). My favorite dishes were the sqUiDON (udon noodle style dish except made from squid) and the Mont-Blanc Pasta. The most amusing part of the night was the takehome gift, usually I expect an extra dessert to be in the box but they gave us a cheeseburger as lunch the next day or a midnight snack. I'm definitely glad I went but don't feel like I need to go back again soon.

1735316960.0,"Frantzen (***) - Stockholm, SE - December 2024","We were lucky enough to snag a reservation for Frantzen’s last day of service before their Christmas break, so naturally, we booked a trip around it, and went and enjoyed what is said to be the best restaurant in the Nordic region. I have to say, this is my first visit to the Nordics, my first fine dining meal in the Nordics, and my second? Neo-Nordic meal, but boy, did we feel like we were dining at the highest level of execution. Our meal starts in the “living room” per se, where we are greeted with our amuse bouchés. Keep in mind, a lot of the bites in these pictures are different, rather than two of the same, because of my girlfriend’s food preferences:

1st picture - croustade with sunchoke, white truffle and swedish cheese Västerbotten - a very light bite to start with, umami flavours, truffle-forward but inoffensively so

2nd picture - Blini with celeriac and buckwheat, otoro (belly of bluefin) tuna and Japanese ginger and wasabi - primary flavours of buckwheat, light, texture is a bit mushy, but pleasantly so. Wasabi flavours jumping out at the end

3rd picture - tartlet with Norwegian langoustine claws, mayonnaise-based sauce, shiso flower - very well layered flavours, mayonnaise initially then the sweet sea flavours of the langoustine, finished off by the herbal flavours of the thai basil and shiso flower - wow. What a showcase in flavour technique and cooking excellence! So far, the bites have been nothing short of amazing.

4th picture - the famous råraka - potato cylinder pancake, filled with creme fraiche with lemon, pickled red onions, roe -  a bite that takes two days to prepare and is eaten in two bites - the contrast in textures here is very well showcased - the crunchiness of the cylinder pancake, combined with the creaminess and richness of the filling, then cut through by the acidity of the lemon and the pickled red onion, a rich but light bite, one of many iconic Frantzen dishes that will wow us throughout the menu

5th picture - ingredients list for tonight; you can see there is no shortage of premium ingredients here - langoustine, caviar, foie gras, A5 wagyu, truffles, lots of luxurious Japanese ingredients

6th picture - the last amuse bouche for tonight, a foie gras macaron, with lemongrass and cumquat - the outside is crunchy, while the filling - very rich and foie-gras forward, very flavourful and honestly delicious

7th picture - our first proper dish for today - crudo of Norwegian scallops, wasabi oil, buttermilk, shiso, marinated Kohlrabi with salt and citrus, and underneath - a sea urchin emulsion. - Light, balanced flavours, herbal, cut through by the buttermilk, with the soft texture of the scallop, paired well with our Non-Alcoholic pairing, which made the dish’s sweet flavours come out more

8th picture - langoustine tail with Nishiki rice and two different dips - saffron-based yuzu sauce and Galangal sauce - the saffron sauce was quite umami and savoury , the yuzu sauce - herbal and light, bit spicy from the galangal. Crunchy rice base, very, very flavourful langoustine, some of the finest I’ve ever tried

9th picture - the famed Chawanmushi egg custard, pork belly broth, exclusive “Frantzen selection” caviar, chives - very, very strong umami flavours, the broth was very flavourful and punchy in a good way, finished off by the abundance of high-quality caviar. I am a sucker for strong umami-forward dishes, and this was a highlight for me. Elevated so much more by the oxidised pear juice with roasted Japanese rice pairing. Tasted oaky and mimicked wine so well.

10th picture - monkfish with pumpkin hot sauce, kosho beurre blanc, citrus marinated roe (ikura), lime “caviar” - again, well balanced, layered flavours - you start with the savoury umami flavours, adding on the beurre blanc sauce - one of my favourite sauces coming from French cuisine - rich and creamy, then we get the spiciness from the kosho seasoning and pumpkin hot sauce, finally finished off by the slight acidity of the lime caviar, found in the sauce. A masterclass in execution!

11th picture - yet another famed Frantzen dish. French toast. Spelt sourdough, parmesan cream, Spanish winter truffle , 20 yo ged balsamic. This was served alongside a glass of complementary Madeira “Rainwater”, which tasted a lot like sherry, and a raisin water with mushrooms and brown butter non-alcoholic pairing. Wow, where do I even start. The french toast was very pleasantly crunchy, cheesy, with very deep truffle flavours, absolutely elevated to the highest level by the caramely, slightly earthy notes of the non-alcoholic pairing juice. If this was a 19/20 bite by itself, the pairing elevated it to a 22/20. One of the favourites of the night.

12th picture - some of our wines for the night - a 2018 Quazzolo Barbaresco - black fruit-forward, light, fruity, playful;  2009 Philippe de Rothschild Chateau d'Armailhac - way more tannic, spicy and full-bodied ; the Rainwater Madeira - caramely, boozy

13th picture - Aaand another classic dish. A very humble, but cozy dish. Onion soup - caramelised onion puree, liquorice and almond oil, crunchy almonds and almond milk foam - crunchy roasted almonds, light foam, sweet onion flavour, light liquorice cream. Warm hug in a bowl as described. I’ve had many a onion soup in fine dining establishments, and this one has to be my favourite. An amazing contrast in textures, foaminess, lightness, crunchiness ; well balanced flavours, at the front - sweetness from the caramelised onions, enriched by the nuttiness of the almonds, balanced out by the liquorice oil.

14th picture - Kagoshima A5 Wagyu , topped with Japanese mushroom, shoots, finished with ginger and lemongrass sauce and sichuan pepper oil, dehydrated brisket, served alongside the bread from the next picture

15th picture - brioche bread with brown butter, double fermented butter ; the non-alcoholic pairing is a blueberries and blackberries and maitake mushrooms juice

Now. This is my first time trying A5 Wagyu, and I gotta say, wow. Buttery soft, delicious lemongrass and sichuan pepper oil sauce, that we made sure we scooped up with every last bite of the bread. The brisket added a nice crunch to the otherwise soft Wagyu, complemented so well by the umami and earthy, sour flavours of the pairing. If anything from the N-A pairing resembled wine the most, it would be this juice.

16th picture - our pre-dessert - dried blackcurrant, white currant, blackcurrant sorbet, blackcurrant leaf jelly, seasoned with hibiscus oil - refreshing, blackcurrant on blackcurrant, cold and acidic, very fruity and light ; also elevated by the N-A pairing juice mentioned above

17th picture - I had a look through the wine list, and something caught my eye. They did 1998 Chateau D’Yquem by the glass, for 1250 SEK, or around £90. Given that dessert was coming, and it was a very indulgent one, I felt like a glass was warranted. “The big guns”, as our waiter described it. Sweet, dried apricots, caramel flavours, honey and peachy flavours, a bit saffrony. What a wine! The colour definitely matches the flavour.

18th picture - Served alongside a non-alcoholic pairing of black lapsang tea , cloudberry, honey - a very smokey tea, thanks to the lapsang base. The dessert: raisins and banana , banana slices, japanese sugar twill, rum and raisin ice cream, topped with an abundance of shaved frozen foie gras, finished with Pedro Ximenez reduction syrup - cold , lots of layers, crispy, lots of depth and evolving flavours, goes well w the smoky NA pairing. A masterclass in textures, flavours, execution. An “overkill dessert”, as called by the chef who finished it tableside. I agree, and I am all here for it!

19th picture - we are taken back to the living room, where we have a nice chat with our service staff, and are presented with the “tower” of petit fours: from bottom to top: 
pate de fruit - red grape and batak pepper - tastes surprisingly rosey ;
white chocolate and pistachio chocolate - creamy, bit nutty, light and sweet, bit of herbal flavours coming in from the tarragon ; walnut chocolate with cep mushroom - nice earthy flavours, creamy filling, light ; 
black garlic fudge - surprisingly very garlicky , red chocolate - Aleppo pepper - spicy and sweet, creamy filling. Very pleasant, indeed ; 
raspberry, earl grey macaron and vanilla cream - subtle earl grey flavours, nice tart raspberry cream in the middle ; 
milkan mandarin macaron with pumpkin - more pumpkin dominated, didn’t get mandarin at all

20th picture - The famed Frantzen madelaines, seasoned with miso - light, very fluffy, very pleasantly sweet; a perfect end to an amazing meal

Now, onto the service. It felt like you were in a friend’s home and they were cooking for you. Everyone was down to chat to us and they did initiate conversations, they were very friendly, respectful, and of course, helpful. We did get a couple cheeky top ups, and a complementary glass of the Madeira, which was not included in our non-alcoholic pairing, as well as a glass of non-alcoholic sake. The ambiance of the living room was just as you’d imagine it - a living room of a good friend, except you are served world class food there. The downstairs dining room was very intimate, dominated by the large shared kitchen table, alongside a couple tables to the side. We asked for more intimate seating, so we were given a two-top that looked at the kitchen.

The way the chefs cooked was so satisfying to watch. It felt like a well choreographed dance, everyone knew where they were supposed to be and what they were supposed to do. We liked how each dish was presented by a different member of staff, mostly chefs, who introduced themselves, the dish, and suggestions on how to enjoy it best. 

The food was unsurprisingly , world class. The Frantzen classics - unforgettable. The flavours - strong, punchy, but also surprisingly well-balanced and layered. Nearly every ingredient listed could be tasted and differentiated, which is a rarity, even at this level, as some ingredients tend to get lost in the mix. I am a big sucker for umami , and the dishes definitely hit a spot, and they hit it Bullseye at that. The non-alcoholic pairing - very interesting and flavourful, did complement the dishes very well. The wines that we had - amazing. 
Value-wise. The menu starts at 4800 SEK, which is around 350 GBP. For that, you get a plethora of luxurious, premium and imported ingredients. Especially for the Nordics, the value is there. With wines and everything, and a small tip, I paid 14000 SEK for two. I would say it’s cheaper than some of my other meals, but ranked higher than them. If The Living Table at Disfrutar is my best meal ever, then this is a very, very, very, very close second. I’d rate it 19.5/20 overall. Cannot recommend it enough!",finedining

1735274668.0,Nōksu - NYC (*),"Nōksu is an intimate chefs counter restaurant serving a seafood-heavy menu nestled in the heart of the subway system (near 32nd street). It was just awarded its first star so I decided to check it out.

The space is cozy and definitely small, but its lack of size is hardly felt during the dining experience. From the moment we stepped into restaurant the service was tight and kind - no issues there. 

The food, unfortunately, left me a bit disappointed. Particularly I was sad to have missed out on the Squab — a dish that had seemed almost synonymous with Nōksu in all the media I had seen.

I probably wouldn’t return to Nōksu, but am glad to have at least tried it.

Notes on the food:

Albacore Tuna - Surprisingly had a BBQ like flavor to it, not bad. 7/10

Sardines - Plated beautifully with a nice punchy flavor. 8/10

Blood Clam - Delicate broth but nothing memorable. 7/10

Horse Mackerel - Surprisingly very deep, almost spicy flavor. Enjoyed this. 8.5/10

Surf Clam - This went really well with the custard and caviar. 9/10

Squid - The squid itself didn’t taste like much but you could tell it was cooked well. 5/10

Tilefish - Good citrusy broth with this one. Didn’t enjoy the liver the fish was lying on. 6/10

Broken Rice - The supposed hearty course left me very disappointed. Didn’t really get any flavor from this. 3/10

Monkfish - Solid, but perhaps I was a bit disappointed since I was expecting a meat course.  Not a huge fan of the sauces. 7/10.

Barley Sorbet - Paired with Yuzu and Champagne Ice was a very nice palate cleanser. 8/10

Shiitake Mushroom Macaron - Didn’t taste the mushroom but was a very nice macaron. 8.5/10

Anniversary Dessert - Can’t remember what was in this one. It was surprisingly doughy in texture but in a positive sense. 7/10

Makgeolli and Coconut - Another good dessert. The pistachio and raspberry was quite good. 8.5/10


Though most dishes were solid, the few disappointing ones and a lack of any real mind-blowing courses left me wanting more.",finedining

1735171577.0,"Aska *, Regensburg, Germany ","Last week, we had the pleasure of dining at Aska in Regensburg, Germany—a Michelin-starred sushi restaurant. The experience was truly exceptional, with beautifully crafted dishes and an impressive level of precision. The eel and tuna nigiri stood out as absolute highlights, showcasing the mastery of the chef.

What makes Aska even more special is that it is led by the same owner behind the one-starred Storstad and the current chef of the German national soccer team. We were lucky enough to sit in the front row, allowing us to watch the sushi master at work—a mesmerizing display of skill and artistry that I highly recommend.

The only slight downside was the lack of a sweet conclusion to the menu, unless you ordered an additional dessert (which, to be fair, was fantastic).

1735028410.0,"Hirō Ishizaka - Tokyo, Japan - Sushi","I wanted to share an updated review of Hirō Ishizaka, a 1-Michelin Star sushi restaurant located in the Hirō neighborhood of Tokyo, Japan.  This past year, I’ve had many Redditors reach out directly to me asking about the restaurant, inquiring about reservations, and sharing positive experiences. Almost everyone has asked, “Why isn’t this place more popular? Is there something I’m missing?” 

Ishizaka-san opened his namesake restaurant in September 2022 after serving as the head chef at Nishiazabu Taku for 6 years while Takuya-san was in Hawaii serving as Nakazawa-san’s second chef at Sushi Sho Hawaii. His Tabelog score hovers around an absurdly low 3.34. This is mostly because of the low review account and no reviews from “super reviewers.” I’ve recommended this restaurant to many this past year and most have shared afterwards that it was one of their most enjoyable meals while in Japan.

There’s little resemblance to Ishizaka-san’s course from Nishiazabu Taku. He started with a clean slate and implemented a Otsumami-to-Nigiri flow rather than the Sho-style course at Nishiazabu Taku. Shari is a komezu/akazu blend with the akazu adding a more prominent punch than other restaurants doing a similar blend. 

Here’s a summary of the course from this December.

1. Seiko Crab with Roe and Shari
2. Tai and Wild Hotate
3. Ankimo with a Daikon/Ponzu Sauce
4. Shirako with a Shoyu/Shichimi Sauce

19. Anago
20. Tamago
21. Strawberry (from Nara)

*** = Top 3 Dishes

Reservations are taken by phone or SMS for new customers (SMS in English okay). Availability is typically wide open at 2 months out. The counter seats 8 but he rarely books out any one seating. There are typically two seatings, 6 and 9pm, but there’s flexibility in how he manages things. It’s just Ishizaka-san and his wife running the entire operation.

Damage for this course with a half bottle of champagne and free flowing sake all evening was 40K Yen per person. 

I highly recommend visiting if you’re looking for somewhere that isn’t overly lauded with attention. This meal was one of my favorites of the year, and it’s hard to beat the cost-performance anywhere else in Tokyo. ",finedining

3:onjium(Seoul) wow!!! We were in love with every single part of that building.
4:Zen(Singapore) perfection all along. Just perfect no other words fit here.

7:Dewakan(KL) The atmosphere is incredible, the food is very good, but nothing I haven’t had before.
8:Toyo eatery(Manila) very casual but we loved it, true authentic experience, very happy with it and the price is also very fair.
9:mingles(Seoul) was our last meal in Seoul, pretty good, but got pretty much overshadowed by our next restaurant visits
10:samrub samrub Thai(Bangkok) we loved the food there and the chef, only minus is that most dishes were fried, so we left feeling quite heavy.

14:Meta(Singapore)good meal, no identity.
15:Gaggan(Bangkok) very fun place, food is very forgettable and boring.
16:Metiz(Manila) could have skipped that, and just stick to Toyo eatery instead. Not bad tho.
17:Potong(Bangkok) way too much story telling.

1734995252.0,RON Gastrobar (*) Amsterdam,"Ron Gastrobar (*) Amsterdam

I was excited by the chance to finally have dinner at Ron Gastrobar in Amsterdam after reading/watching several positive reviews of the restaurant.

This evening I finally got to visit this establishment and was quickly deflated by the poor service which became complete disappointment at the entire experience.

My wife and I each ordered the Blaauwdruk, which is the four-course “chef surprise me” menu.  This was a complete joke because three of the four courses came directly off the menu. The server told us when we ordered

So here is my thoughts on each course.

Starter course: the only non-menu item we got. It was a foie gras with a port glaze between slices of a brioche toast and an apple compote. The brioche toast reminded both of us of something that tasted like gingerbread and while it wasn’t terrible, it was not interesting either. This dish was at best…just okay. 

Entree #1: was smoked eel on a potato terrine with pepperoni and sorrel. This dish was just awful. The taste of black pepper was so overwhelming that I simply didn’t want to finish it. Both my wife and I didn’t finish because it was just too unpleasant to eat. This led to us getting Entree #2, which by this point we didn’t even want and tried to convince the server to please just bring us the next course, but that was not happening.

Entree #3: was salmon with ouzo in a buerre blanc foam. This was also a disappointment because the fish was undercooked. Both ends were cooked and the center was nearly raw.

Main: pheasant in pastry with blood sausage and sauerkraut. Another disappointing course. It would have benefited from some salt to help it with some flavor.

Dessert: Merengue with ice cream and amarena cherries. This was an okay dessert, but uninspired.

Overall the food ranged from simply disappointing to outright awful.

I would also add that to get through these four courses took 3 hours.  Simply unacceptable. A couple in line behind us at the coat check mentioned they only got 2 courses over a 3 hour stretch and were just done with the place.

We actually watched the manager chew out a couple different servers in front of us on different occasions. I can say nothing good about the experience.

1734960347.0,"Restaurant Julien Binz - Ammerschwihr, France (*)","There hasn't been a report from Julien Binz a few years, so I figured an update would be necessary. We went with a group of four mid-December and had a fantastic time.

We got reservations through the waitlist since our preferred time was full  and were notified about 2 weeks prior to the desired date that they would have a table for us. Since the main dining room was full, the way they accommodated us off of the waitlist was to put us into a semi-private side room. Honestly, I think this just added to the experience since it was beautifully decorated and we did not feel like an afterthought in any way whatsoever. We also really appreciated that they managed to fit us in despite being fully booked!

We took the ""Fragonard Menu"" for the entire table - which is the set menu for 128 EUR per person. You can also order a la carte. We also took a wine pairing of 3 glasses for 60 EUR each. The menu was as follows:

\- Two amuses (not pictured): One was a pastry cone filled with orange / sweet potato puree and the other was a pastry pillow filled with a tarte flambee cream and topped with a small lardon. Both were tasty, but not incredibly special.

\- Appetizer (picture 1): Chestnut soup with pumpkin. Very taste and seasonal. Beautiful presentation; chef plated it in front of us.

\- Course #1 (picture 2): Foie gras 2-ways. Two separate dishes served together - but I only took a picture of one dish. One plating was the foie gras ravioli with onion jam, onion cream, and roasted onions. The other plating was a pan seared foie gras topped with a black truffle gelee. Both were delicious, but the ravioli in particular were fantastic and perfectly balanced

\- Course #2 (picture 3): Pike perch with crispy bacon/potatoes and riesling sauce. Another excellent course. The fish was stuffed with sauerkraut and topped with a light horseradish cream. Every single component worked well together and individually.

\- Course #3 (picture 4): Scallops 2-ways. Two seaprate dishes served together. The larger plate was a pan-seared scallop with different preparation of cauliflower in a mussel, orange, and vanilla sauce. This was our favorite dish of the evening -- the flavors were potent, balanced, and quite unique. The other plating was a scallop crudo that was fine, but not really memorable.

\- Course #4 (picture 5): Venison 2-ways. Two separate dishes served one after another. The first part of the course (not pictured) was a 12 hour slow cooked venison stew that was simple in flavor profile, but delicious nonetheless. The second part was the filet with a blackberry sauce and a crispy potato pastry filled with potato puree. Despite not being the most creative dish, it was perfectly executed and quite delicious. Pairing with a pinot noir from a couple villages over was best of the night as well.

\- Course #5 (pictures 6 and 7): We took two separate desserts and split them. One was an apple / cinnamon mille-feiulle with a creme brulee ice cream. The second was a chocolate hazelnut praline with a coffee ice cream. Pretty classic flavors, but again beautifully executed and incredibly tasty.

\- Mignardises (picture 8): Chocolate/cherry, chestnut/mandarin, coconut/cinnamon. Very punchy, no faults. We also got espressos afterwards and were served 3 truffles (basil/white chocolate, caramel/milk chocolate, and hazelnut/dark chocolate).

\- Wine pairing: Generous pours, very knowledgeable sommelier, and paired perfectly with the intended courses. I can't remember specifics, but it is was 2 white wines (one from Loire, another from SW France) and 1 pinot noir (from Alsace). It wasn't the best pairing ever, but we felt for 60 EUR it was a fair value.

\- Service: Excellent all night. Attentive, but not overbearing. The chef himself attended to our table for multiple courses. The sommelier was a standout as well, even beyond the wine.

Overall verdict: For 188 EUR including wine, we felt this was a very good value for a 4-hour experience in a 1\* restaurant. There were three excellent courses (foie gras, pike perch, and scallops) and two very good courses. Although it wasn't the most creative meal in the world, everything was perfectly executed and we were still surprised by unusual flavor combinations for some of the courses. I would rank this near the top of the 1\* Michelin we have visited, and also above a couple 2\* restaurants.

Once you enter the gate, they have this beautiful courtyard with city-protected trees where you enjoy your first few bites. Then you move to the split chef’s counter for the rest of the meal.

I haven’t posted every single course as there like 25 of them but the majority of them, especially the eye candy ones, are here. Skip the pics of you want to avoid spoilers lol. My favorites of the night were the truffle mushroom tarte (they had a smaller version of this at the previous iteration of Somni) and the sweet shrimp chawanmushi seafood risotto dish. Only thing I didn’t enjoy was the main beef dish; thought the steak was too rare and kinda tough but I’m sure it was intentional with the older cow he was using. Plating and presentation for every course was absolutely beautiful. 

Service was impeccable too; they had a lot of nice quality of life things such as free valet, blankets in the courtyard, utensil and utensil resting stones changing every course, synchronized service, etc. Shoutout to the head hospitality person MJ for remembering me from Somni 1.0 (I’m sure they have data for this but it still felt nice to be “recognized”). Chef Aitor and his team are running on full cylinders and I expect for them to get 2 Michelin stars back in the guide next year.",finedining
1734912802.0,"L’effervescence (***) - Tokyo, Japan","The second restaurant on our trip was L’effervescence. This was a return visit after a great meal last year. Arriving at the restaurant, we were greeted by the hosts who kindly told us, “Welcome back. We have been expecting you.”  We were seated at the same table as last year. Little touches that set the restaurant apart from others. For the meal, I opted to try the premium pairing while my dining companions went for wine by the glass. Everyone was in agreement for the truffle add on for the main course. 

The meal was quite similar to what we had last year:

Welcome- omotenashi cocktail of shochu. &#10;  
Vegetable crisps, tofu sour cream &#10;  
Winter- shirako, surf clam, risotto, caviar &#10;  
Genesis of civilization - potato focacia, sour dough &#10;  
Ars longa, Vita brevis - 62 kinds of vegetables &#10;  
Fixed point- Tokyo turnip &#10;  
Tranquil depth - Whey marinated silver pomfret, nori, taro, lemon &#10;  
Tapestry of life- Kyoto duck, beetroot, jus, black and white truffle &#10;  
Duck thigh ravioli, sweet potato, consommé &#10;  
Migration - selection of Japanese cheeses &#10;  
Homage- chestnut, ginko nuts &#10;  
Selection of mignardise &#10;  
World peace &#10;  
Japanese tea ceremony &#10;  

This was another delightful meal at L’effervescence. The dishes were all very similar to our last meal, but some time that’s ok. I knew what to expect, and the restaurant delivered that and some more. Service was excellent throughout. My only complaint was they kept the room quite warm. 

L’effervescence will not give you the best meal ever. What this restaurant would deliver, however, is a great sense of place unique to Tokyo. ",finedining

1734899137.0,"Hide, London, UK (*)","£56 set lunch - great value anytime but in December, 5 days before Christmas? Excellent.   Decent £44 bottle of white (I'm not knowledgeable on wine, happy to buy cheap 😁).   The bread basket was £12 - probably not worth that but it was good.  Don't ask me why but we both HATED the dessert - I think the milk chocolate was just too much, there wasn't much contrast.  The lamb tartare was the  standout course although didn't photograph well.  The malt loaf sauce with the duck was magic and I'm attempting a version to go with my Christmas ham.  Not sure I'd rush to go back - there was long waits to order (and the place wasn't full by any stretch) and some of the staff were a bit impersonal and aloof.

1734898497.0,South of Spain Rankings,"Just wrapped up my food tour of 6 restaurants in 4 days across the south of Spain. 

Here is my personal ranking based solely on food:
1. Bardal ⭐️⭐️ - Incredible food executed at a very high level. I liked every single dish from their long menu. With just a bit more attention to detail in their service and they would likely get another star.

2. Vandelvira ⭐️ - Beautiful restaurant in an old monastery with very creative and exquisit dishes. Enjoyed the entire menu expect for only 1 dish. Many courses were prepared in front which was very nice to interact with the chefs.

3. Bagá ⭐️ - Probably the most creative of all the restaurants I went - still thinking about some of the dishes and combinations. Sounds crazy but these blew my mind: steak with vanilla, lettuce with ice cream, and fried egg with almonds for dessert. And they are also the smallest Michelin restaurant in the world.

4. Radis ⭐️ - A young team putting out great plates but the restaurants above are just another level. Loved the cozy open kitchen with only 4 tables and the chef interacting with everyone. Great energy!

5. Noor ⭐️⭐️⭐️ - The best service of all, they were on top of every single detail, but expected for a restaurant of this tier. Loved how the storytelling went along with the history of the city. BUT there were multiple dishes that I simply disliked. 

6. Meson Sabor Andalus ⭐️ - Vegetable-forward restaurant, which is not common across spain but they want to highlight vegetables in season in this region. Most dishes had animal protein (primarily seafood) which went well with the theme. If looking for an alternative to Iberiam ham, this is a good option in this area. 

This region of Spain offers a great value for money. Except for Noor and Bardal, all tasting menus were around €70-90 euros per person (excl. drinks). Highly recommend as an alternative to the other big cities.",finedining

1734882850.0,Takai by Kashiba - Chef’s Counter Omakase,"My very first fine dining tasting experience, spoiled by the brilliant Jun Takai of Takai by Kashiba in Bellevue, WA. The 23-course omakase tasting meal featured local and international fish, mixed with fresh and aged preparation styles.

The champagne and sake pairing came with four tastings; Champagne Laherte Freres Rose de Meunier, Tedorigawa Kinka Sake, Otokoyama Sake Junmai Kimoto Special Pure Rice Sake, and Champagne Pierre Gimmonet & Fils Gastronome Blanc de Blanc to finish.

Two summers ago, I had the great pleasure while serving at Matthews Winery in Woodinville, WA in working an event we hosted for the legendary Shiro Kashiba. He flew in from retirement in Japan to give a speech in front of 150 attendees, with sushi paired with several of our sauvignon blanc options. I became friends with Ed Kashiba at this event over a bottle of our Tenor label Grenache. Ultimately I decided I must visit Ed for my first fine dining experience and was not at all disappointed. I was very fortunate he stopped by our seats at the Chef’s Counter to say shake my hand so I could personally give him his gift bottle. I could not say enough kind words about the Kashiba family, thank you Ed.

Unfortunately there was no printed menu of the tasting to reference and sometimes it was a little difficult to understand what was being served. I don’t have a great write up of the food pictured, frankly I assume the intelligent people in this subreddit can let me know what I was enjoying. I will mention a special shout out to the Sardine dish which Takai said was his personal favorite on the menu. I think I also figured out Blue Fin Tuna is my favorite sashimi of choice.

I do not really have the time to detail every course but I'll leave a photo up of the menu. We had the wagyu supplement. 

Photos should be in menu order. Terrific meal, definitely the best I have had and it's a travesty that it doesn't have at least two stars, if not three. At least it has been awarded 5 AA Rosettes which definitely showcase what terrific stuff they're putting out.

The place is a 15th century villa, 8 km from the high-speed train station, take a taxi or hire a car, private parking.

Everything is delicious, the signature dishes are the one with garlic mousse (don't worry, no strong garlic flavour) and the Babà, a dessert from Naples (where the chef comes from), you wouldn't believe how soft, light and tasty it is.

The amuse-bouche offers a variety of flavours, reinterpreting international dishes such as baozi and macarons with local product.

Hidden gems include the tiny chocolate tiramisu and the crunchy sfogliatella napoletana, also known as prawn tail.

1734836019.0,The Clocktower (NYC),"Went to the Clocktower tonight after a show.

The atmosphere was very calm and relaxed and decorated nicely for the holidays. I will say that the room was a bit too dark as I could just about read the menu. Also, no pictures because the ones I took don't look great with the poor lighting. 

The service was fine and the staff were attentive. Nothing crazy, which is fine for me.

Appetizer: I had the scotch egg. It was spiced nicely and the crust and egg was delicious with the sauce served underneath.

Entree: I had the Shepard's pie. It was served in a gold skillet with the crust as crumbs on top of the crusted mashed potatoes. The filling was beef and vegetables. Absolutely delicious. It was my first time having a Shepard's pie and I highly recommend it.

Dessert: I had the baked Alsaka, served table side for the flambe. It was served with cherries and little candies. The ice cream was delicious and the bottom layer was a chocolate chip cookies. Also, the meringue was just the right level of sweetness. It was absolutely delicious, but I was so full I couldn't finish it. 😅

I had this all with a glass of rose. 

Overall, I would rate this a 8/10 for me. I definitely recommend it, particularly if you're looking for ""traditional"" English food. ",finedining

Because it is the holiday season the restaurant is only offering a standard five-course tasting menu with an optional wine pairing.

Since I posted the menu I will only offer comments on a couple of the dishes. Each of the five courses was excellent and full of interesting flavors and textures. The two outstanding dishes for me were the starter and the dessert courses.

I was really surprised by the combination of scallops with a pumpkin/potato salad. It was delightful and my wife and I keep talking about it throughout the dinner.

The dessert was an outstanding combination of chocolate, yuzu, and pear. It was paired with an amazing Madeira and just a perfect way to end a fantastic dinner.

1734815645.0,"The Inn at Little Washington, Virginia (***)","My first 3 star tasting menu experience. It did not disappoint and in fact, even exceeded expectations! First off, upon just entering the Inn the ambiance is SO luxe but cozy at the same time. Especially being around Christmas the trees and lights were up, the fireplace was going, and it was such a vibe. Restaurant staff was all very nice, from the hosts, servers, Somm, etc. Went with 3 other people who have no dietary restrictions and got the Gastronaut's menu with the Szechuan Pepper-crusted venison tenderloin as the entree. I am Pescetarian and they were able to swap out the final entree with A Mosaic of Autumn Vegetables on a Potato Rosti from the Good Earth menu. I love how inspired the meal was with local VA ingredients.

We were served 3 amouse bouche. Photos are all in order of the courses that were served:

Amuse Bouche 1: roasted oyster with a buttermilk foam type of sauce on top that was cheesy and decadent and SUCH a tasty bite

Amuse Bouche 2: potato chip cannoli with pimento and chive. This was probably one of my favorite bites - so creative! a savory potato chip cannoli!! Literally bite sized perfection.

Amuse Bouche 3: garlic mushroom custard with sunchokes and cauliflower. This was also very tasty and decadent and had really fun textures. The creaminess from the mousse/custard with the small bites of the vegetables.

The bread service offered a poppyseed baguette, sourdough slice, or currant pecan rye slice

First course: we all got the caviar with crab and cucumber rillette. served with a brioche toast. very tasty.

Second course: Carpaccio of big eye tuna and swordfish with Wasabi sorbet. We all loved this course!! The wasabi sorbet was also so creative and fun and tasty! Never had that flavor served in that type of way before. And it paired so beautifully with the fish. The tuna and swordfish were brushed with yuzu and there was a pickled lemon or something on top that just added such a nice bright acidity to the meal and rounded out all the amazing flavors on the plate. Perfect harmony. Served with a shrimp crisp.

Third course: Cabbage with Maine Lobster and caviar beurre blanc. Sounds basic, but WOW. The lobster was the best cooked lobster I've ever had. It was so soft, it cut like butter. And the dish was overall so flavorful and the perfect textures and seriously the best lobster I've ever had. Will be dreaming about this one forever.

Fourth course: A Mosaic of Autumn Vegetables on a Potato Rosti. I was obsessed with every single thing on this dish. The ratatouille dumpling was sooo flavorful literally a burst of flavor in the most delicious dumpling. I could have had 10 of those. The vegetables on the potato rosti I believe were eggplant, zucchini, and squash (IIRC). The potato was perfectly crunchy, and the sauce and veggies on top were so flavorful and soft that it added such a nice contrast against the crisp of the potato. Served with a goat cheese mousse which was also so creamy and added that fat content to the dish to elevate it even more. Everyone else in my party got the Szechuan Pepper-crusted venison tenderloin which is the only thing I didn't get a picture of. They all loved that dish as well.

Fifth course / palette cleanser: Paw Paw Posset. Local berry that tastes a bit like a cross b/w passionfruit and apple to me. Served with a shortbread cookie and a George Washington souvenir which was a fun touch. Very unique flavors you don't get to taste often. Really nice dish.

Dessert course: I got the Pear cheesecake and my partner got the selection of cheeses. The pear was probably my least favorite course of everything, but still a truly delicious bite to end on. It was shaped like a pear and the stem and leaf were also edible (made of tasted like chocolate). The outside was the cheesecake aspect and the inside had bits of pear that was a nice textural component. The cheese course was really fun, the guy had a lot of puns and was great. Served with an Ethiopian honey that was so floral and light and delicious.

Lastly, they sent us off with some pastries/chocolates in little bags that look like the Inn. So cute!! And such a fun thing to keep the meal continuing on the next day.

As for wine, we did not do the wine pairing. Instead, the Somm helped us pick out 3 bottles that were all very good. We got two whites and a red. The standout was a Portuguese white we had called Raríssimo Bairrada White 2017. The most complex white I've ever had.

Tasting menu was $388 pp, plus tax and gratuity for four came to $2,014.50 USD (not including wine).

Overall, such a phenomenal experience. With tasting menus and fine dining, it's easy to have one or two courses that you think are just ""okay"", but with this one, truly every bite was so flavorful and delicious and memorable. The whole evening was truly perfect. And although there are so many restaurants I want to try, this one was so exceptional that I would love to return some day

Japanese-Mexican cuisine has incredible possibilities, but Crudo misses the mark entirely. The eight-course menu, priced at an eye-watering 1,300 pesos per person, offers little more than confusion on a plate.

Even capturing the disaster for posterity was impossible—the lighting in the restaurant is atrocious. Save your appetite, your wallet, and your evening.

I was doing some cleaning and found the thermal bag with a take home meal kit from Saison. I thought this group might enjoy the story.

  
As I'm sure everyone remembers crazy things happened during the pandemic. One amazing thing was that Saison created take home kits. I had the opportunity to order a meal and make it at home.  It was great. 

  
This was around Feb or March of 2021.  The kit contained everything for a dinner for 2 including step by step instructions for heating and plating.  The main course was a duck breast - this was sent cooked very rare and still on the carcass so when re-heating, it would not overcook.  There was a QR code that linked to a video on how to reheat and remove the breast meat from the bone and serve.  

The duck turned out perfectly cooked and the instructions made everything simple to follow.  I don't remember the other details to describe each course, other than it was all good. 

  
I did several take home dinners from various local San Francisco fine dining establishments during the pandemic, but most of them were not very memorable. Saison was truly creative for their kit. 

Images include: Saison bag, instructions, scallop course, the cassoulet and herbed broth (and the duck!) ",finedining
1734643121.0,"The Harbor House Inn (**) Elk, Ca ","Was so excited to travel to Elk to dine and stay at Harbor House for my 40th Birthday and it most certainly did not disappoint. This was without a doubt the most complete dining experience I've ever had - everything about this place is nothing but effortless mastery - the food, the service, the setting all work together to create a one of a kind experience and a lasting memory 

Missed a couple pics but this is most of the meal - shout out to the somm for recommending a great bottle (Armand Heitz Chassagne-Montrachet 21 I believe) that went great with the meal. My wife got the N/A pairing and there were some amazing drinks served - Standouts were the passionfruit and the savory apple cider that had such a round an deep flavor (these same flavors were echoed in the apple butter at breakfast the next morning). Also the dessert drink was crazy it tasted like cookie milk lol. Service too was just outrageously good. Our server immediately noticed I was left handed and readjusted my place settings for the rest of the meal and really made us feel special and comfortable. The pacing of the meal, the progression of flavors all felt perfectly orchestrated. I was not over full at all nor was I left hungry. There are no add ons here, there is no caviar service or truffle or French butter. These things are diametrically opposed to what harbor house is doing. 

we started and ended with infusions and ill say this was one of the more ""liquid-forward"" restaurants ive ever eaten at lol. I dont think there was a single reduced or mounted sauce in the meal but the flavors of these broths and infusions were incredible and intense in a way that was very pure to the flavor being presented rather than a reliance on butter or cream. 

First course was chilled vegetables with a variety of leaves and flowers - some were raw, some were poached or gently cooked, bursting with flavor, perfect salt level, a radish that was literally sweet, not ""sweet for a radish""

Next was cured rockfish with a variety of different condiments and a seaweed salad on the side - the fish was so firm and well seasoned on its own but the condiments took it to the next level, especially the black garlic. I will also say I have never found seaweed notable but this meal really changed my view and I understand I just am getting trash seaweed on the east coast and thats the issue 

The Fried Miatake with lace lichen is a ""signature"" Harbor House dish and im really happy I got to try it - impossibly light and crispy mushroom (my favorite mushroom too) and the lichen was very reminiscent of sesame noodles. We took a lot of walks while we were in Northern California and this stuff is literally everywhere so its cool they have figured out a way to cook it because there appears to be an endless supply

Moving on to what was imo the best dish of the meal, red abalone with abalone rice - The abalone itself was incredibly tender and sweet and served with sprouting cauliflower and other winter veg along with a light broth, and then the rice was dressed with a sauce made from the offal of the abalone. This was without a doubt the most deeply flavored and rich rice ive ever eaten. It was almost meaty and kinda reminded me of louisianna dirty rice but creamier and of course with an ocean richness. Mind blowing stuff seriously. 

After that was Lingcod smoked over bay laurel with matsutake and raw porcini - again here, light and pure flavors. Im a big mushroom fan and was really cool to eat the raw porcini, they were so delicious 

Bread course not pictured but wow - the sea lettuce woven through the crumb of the bread added a salty oceanic flavor and the butter was deep and earthy - pretty cool surf and turf idea 

Next was a slice of red Kuri squash with my favorite sauce of the night which was made from fava bean miso and split with herb oil - the squash was dense and soft and sweet and the miso sauce had a bright acidity to it along with a great viscosity that coated everything. Very intense flavors of sweetness and umami here and a great winter dish 

The only meat course of the night was Devils gulch squab - the most perfectly cooked breast of poultry ive ever had and so concentrated with flavor and perfect crispy skin as they ladle 500deg oil over the skin right before carving. The leeks were so sweet and I am a notorious onion hater haha

The Palate cleanser was a beautiful creamy citrus bite, lemon merengue-esque. good time to comment on all the citrus in this meal and how much more fragrant and interesting it was to the usual lemons and limes I have access to.

Main dessert was a persimmon parfait of sorts - pieces of spiced cake, cooked persimmons, a very airy/creamy yogurt component - familiar and comforting flavors but not like anything I've eaten before 

Petit Fours spread was unreal - won't go through every bite but will just say these all felt very intentional and not just 'for the sake of fine dining' 

  
if you dont care about eating caviar and truffles and want to eat a meal that is an true encapsulation of the place it inhabits, this is the place to do that. Harbor House has a strong ethos and sticks to it, and its front and center with everything they do",finedining

1734632846.0,"Oriole (**) Chicago, USA","I don’t think I have ever felt so special at any establishment than I did at Oriole the other night. I was spoiled and pampered by chef and his team, and I was smiling the entire meal. The food and hospitality were amazing, but there were 2 specific things they did that made this so special for me that I will talk about before reviewing the whole experience. I was a solo diner as well.

After eating my amuse bouche at the bar, my server informed me about beverage pairings and the white truffle seasonal special which was a $150 add on. I passed on both and was taken to my seat. Few courses later, Chef Larry brought out the special white truffles and shaved them on my capellini course. My server explained to me that Chef Larry wanted me to enjoy the white truffle special and didn’t want me to leave without trying it. I was so taken back and couldn’t stop saying thank you. Later on I also was given a second white truffle special for an additional dessert next to the petite fours. Alongside all of this, my server gave me the non-alcoholic pairing which blew my mind as well. I wasn’t charged for the white truffle seasonal special or the NA pairing, as it was a gift from Chef Larry and the team. I am so grateful for this and was so happy. I literally couldn’t stop smiling and saying thank you throughout the whole meal. My server Amanda was great as well, she explained everything to me perfectly and kept me entertained and engaged throughout the whole meal. Got to talk with chef Larry as well which was such a pleasure.

Amuse Bouche: 
These bites were insane. The first one was inside a clementine consisting of Irish blue lobster, blood orange, and uni. The second was the kampachi with wasabi and Asian pear. The third and final one was served in a buddhas hand which was a tartlet of Maine scallop, salsa matcha, miso, and avocado. That one out of the three was AMAZING, one of the best bites of my life. I can’t describe how flavorful it was. The flavor lingered in my mouth and it was just so flavorful. 

Foie Gras:
After the amuse bouche at the bar, they take you to the open and quiet kitchen where you eat on of their famous courses. Toast with foie gras, mission figs, anise hysopp, and dipndots creme fraiche. This was outstanding as well and loved watching the kitchen. It was so quiet and calm, only about 10 or so chefs.

Golden Kaluga Caviar:
In a small bow you are given a red kuri squash, bone marrow, and a foam. This dish was pretty good as well and they serve a beautiful bread and butter with it. No complaints. 

Carabineros Prawn:
This is probably the only critique I have. Carabineros prawns are so special in terms of flavor and color. They should be highlighted by its sweetness and flavor, I have eaten many prawns in my life all over the world. The carabinero was a tad overcooked and the spicy peppers and sorbet overtook that sweet prawn flavor I was hoping to bite into. If they wanted to serve this special type of prawn, I believe it should be raw or lightly touched on the grill. I didn’t taste any of the shrimp flavor and was hoping for the juices of it. I would never try to poach or infuse a lot of flavor into a carabinero or a gamberro rosso. The dish itself was good and I loved the vision, but I wish I was able to taste more of the prawn.

Beet:
Thinly shaved beets are served over puffed black rice and what seems to be some Goat cheese and sauce. The dish was good, no complaints. Enjoyed the use of chopsticks and how they let me pick my chopstick rest.

Turbot:
A small piece of turbot has these little potato spheres that cover the fillet and are pan seared on to the fish. The bouillabaisse sauce and mussel it was served with was EXCELLENT. So much flavor and loved the additional fennel. Everything about this dish was perfect. 

Capellini:
Man, this pasta was insane. I never knew pasta could be so complex and have that deep of flavor. This is also when chef surprised me with the alba white truffles. It was a capellini made with yeast, buckwheat, and this insane cream sauce. That white truffle took it to another level. So many flavors and super earthy. Loved it, definitely one of the top dishes of the night. 

A5 Miyazaki Wagyu:
This was such a treat, I have had A5 3 times prior to my dinner at Oriole and out of all the times they executed it the best here. You first take a bite of the ribeye cap on a skewer which is topped with a sauce and finger lime. Then you eat the beef while sipping on the bone broth they serve you on the side which warmed me up on the inside. This beef was so insanely rich and tender. The meat itself melted and the fat was bursting out with juices.

Rosemary:
The first dish before the desserts was amazing as well. It was like a lemon sorbet topped with rosemary ice and droplets of olive oil. Super refreshing and got my palate ready for the heavier desserts.

Hukambi Chocolate:
This is one of the best desserts in all of Chicago, the espresso and chocolate flavor was so pure and combined so perfectly in my mouth. The textures were perfect and every bite was so incredibly dreamy.

White Truffle:
The second part of the white truffle special was a small cruller topped with sorbet and shaved white truffles. This was super rich and fragrant, super delicious as well. This was served along my petite fours and a cub of Malabar tea. 

All in all, this experience was legendary. I felt so overwhelmed when they informed me they would give me the non alcoholic pairing and white truffle seasonal special add on as a gift from them. The food was great and executed so perfectly. The space was beautiful and the entrance was so cool! I love how you sit in that cozy elevator-thing and enjoy a hot cup of buckwheat tea while talking to the host. Some of the best hospitality ever and I am so grateful I was able to experience all of this. No surprise that they made an appearance on the Worlds 50 Best List at #95 in 2022. If you are on the edge of deciding to go or not, go!

I’d love to hear from anyone who has been to either/both - which would you recommend?

Personally, we find that service and atmosphere matter a lot to our experience. For example, we just dined at Core and loved the food but didn’t enjoy the cramped environment and “busy” service feel. Also we tend to do wine pairings, and prefer places that are generous on pours/refills - not that we actually drink that much, but we find the “generous” vibe makes the experience feel more luxurious. So if that’s a factor at either restaurant, that’d be helpful to know.

1734577268.0,Which so called top 50 restaurant is actually good/worth the effort to get a reservation at. be honest ,"I’ll probably get slaughtered for this but…

Preface: I don’t care about most instagrammer’s opinion, or somebody from TX who’s fancy meal is at per Se (and claims it’s amazing and life changing, because it isn’t and Thomas Keller is a fraud who does NOT even know how to properly roast a chicken, unless you like it bone dry and without much flavour).


Having said that, which restaurant in your opinion is actually worth the hype and effort to get a reservation at?

I’ll go first just to give you all an idea of the restaurants I still think of: Sushi Arai (Tokyo); meadowood (before they burned down unfortunately); atomix (preferred the upstairs); bo innovation (quite a few years ago so who knows if it’s still good); atera (again a few years ago); Celele (Cartegena); Paste (both Laos and bkk) 

Hated/way overrated/but instagramers may feel obligated to say you loved it but really don’t: l’astrance (been three times, unfortunately); septime (absolutely horrendous); Leo (Bogotá); Kaiamo (Bucharest- they did try very hard but it just didn’t work for us); French laundry (did I already say their chicken was dry as…..); and last but not least, chez Panisse

1734560760.0,"maiBeck * Cologne, Germany ","This is the four-course tasting menu from maiBeck.  Here is a list of the courses:
- bread and butter to begin the evening
- Starter course: a walk in the winter with granola, savoy cabbage and pear from the Vorgebierge, lunga da napoli pumpkin from Buschbell, and beans from Dormagen

- Seafood course: Icelandic haddock and fried mussel with potato and lamb’s lettuce salad

Main course: sauerbraten from local beef with kale, apple, pumpernickel, parsley-root

Dessert course: dark chocolate with marzipan, candied orange and an orange ice cream.

This was a truly delightful meal that was full of flavor and surprises. 

The starter course was the most surprising. The combination of flavors were light and the crunchy texture of the beans and pumpkin seeds were an excellent match for the dish.

The one course that was so-so was the seafood course. The fish was cooked perfectly, but I found it to be a bit bland and really lacking in flavor.

The sauerbraten was incredible in every aspect of the dish. The red wine sauce was rich and decadent with flavor. The apple was a wonderful surprise and not something I generally think of with beef, but it was delicious.

The dessert was lovely and not-overly rich. The hints of orange were a perfect complement to the dark chocolate.

Overall, this was a wonderful experience. The vibe of the restaurant is very convivial and laid back. The servers were pleasant and happy to answer questions, but the pace of everything was slow. If you are expecting white-linen table cloth service, you will be disappointed. This is a place to enjoy a fun ambiance with flavorful food.

1734556521.0,Cycling to my 30th birthday lunch/dinner,"I would like to do a one/two week bike packing route that includes an amazing lunch/dinner for my 30th birthday. I’m confident there is a fair bit of cross over between the cycling and fine dining community, so I’m keen on your recommendations. Which restaurant + region would you pick? 

For context, my husband had his 30th birthday at Asador Etxebarri. Before you ask: we have no idea how he got a reservation, let alone the two-person table. Yes, it was life changing. No, I will not be able to top it. We did a trip around Basque Country (on trains, not bikes). That vibe would be ideal.

I’d like to find a restaurant in a town, so we can stay close-by (not sure I want to rock the bib-shorts and cleats to the restaurant). I have the budget for a nice dinner, but not nice accommodation + dinner, so that rules out some of the wineries or restaurants in very posh hotels (Da Vittorio) that would otherwise work.

1734539429.0,"Per Se (***, NYC)","*Note: pre-emptive apology if the picture quality isn't great. It's very, very dark in that room at 5 pm during in December.

I'm not sure how much else needs to be said about Per Se that hasn't already been said. Other than, I'll just say that I do not, in any way, agree with certain critical reviews by Melissa Clark. On a weekend when I went to four other Michelin-starred restaurants, Per Se is still, by far, the best of them all and it's really not even close. It's possibly the best meal of my life (though perhaps my perfect evening at Jean-Georges in August might be tied/slightly ahead). This is the three-Michelin starred meal that's worth a special journey, the kind I'd recommend people plan their vacations around.

Note, rumor has it that Per Se really pulls out all the stops for solo diners in case they're critics/Michelin judges. I was alone since I'm in town for a work thing, and I do think they put on an extra special show for me (complementary champaign, a tour of the kitchen, some extra cookies that I don't think the table next to me was offered). So, who knows if I just got a really, really perfect meal because of that?

Thoughts on the food:
*The signature Oysters and Pearls is every bit as good as I'd heard, and it doesn't actually taste like what I thought it would. I was expecting something more light and briney, perhaps but it was heavy and creamy, almost cheesy? But oh god. This is the kind of dish that you eat and all of sudden you realize the distinction between two and three star meals. I'd go back just to experience this again.

*The Maine Lobster was so perfectly cooked. It basically just tasted like pure butter and I was living for it. It was served with duxelles, which really ramped up the umami a ton. Couldn't get enough of this dish. 

*When I was served the quail, my first thought was ""dear god this looks and sounds boring,"" but it was actually pleasant. I felt a little bit like a medieval French aristocrat since the quail was served on a bed of oats and apples.

*The lamb! Dear god. Massive portion, and I don't think I've ever had a more pleasing plate of lamb. I don't know what they did to get it to taste like that but it was almost addicting.

*Desserts: so many! I was served 6 different plates of desserts at once. The standouts were the Forelle Pear and the Louix XV cake--one light and fruity, one heavy and rich. 

The ""worst"" dishes of the night were the Black Bass, which even still was pretty freaking good, and the foie gras, which was a supplement. The foie gras was delightful and the dish is one of the most beautiful plates I've ever seen, but I realized after I ate half of it that maybe I don't really like foie gras enough to have that much of it. I've only ever had small portions of it before and that was not a small portion. So, in retrospect I probably should've just had the standard option (avocado, finger limes, etc).

No negative notes. Everything about the experience was incredible and I'll surely be back once my bank account has recovered from this week.

1734531551.0,"I went to Eleven Madison Park (***, NYC) so you don’t have to…","....and to my surprise, I actually liked it a good bit!

Now, do I think it deserves three Michelin stars? Not really. Not if we're going by the guide's heuristic that three stars are ""worth a special journey."" I suppose if you live in New Jersey, Connecticut, or Eastern Pennsylvania, EMP is worth a detour, but I don't think in good conscience I'd recommend it for anyone who lives farther away than that. So, for me that puts it in the 1-2 star range. Perhaps the 2 since there were really some special moments, and overall the experience was one to savor (the near military-level precision with which the servers move around the dining room is alone worth a watch). [Sidenote, but I've noticed a lot of people have talked about how easy it is to get a reservation there now, and while that's probably true, it was absolutely bussing last night. Every single table was full. Maybe just the holiday tourist season? I don't know.]

Having been there, I now think that some of the really hostile reviews of it I've read on here and elsewhere are simply by people who cannot get over the fact that it's not animal-based. Not to say that they are ill-intentioned reviewers, but people who can't imagine that squash would be more exciting to eat than lamb. If you go into this with that mindset, you're sure to be disappointed since it's really not meat and it makes no real attempt at apologizing for not being meat. Instead, it celebrates the vegetables and celebrates them in a way that lets them stand on their own without disguising what they are.

As far as flavor is concerned, it's certainly not bland. No matter what anyone can say, they can't say it's bland. For the most part, each main dish was served with some sort of broth or sauce that usually did the heavy lifting of the plate--not unlike when restaurants serve cooked whitefish, I think. The roasted allium tea was divine--I'd love to buy it in stores if I could. The bread is some of the best bread I've ever had--ever. And I thought the tonburri caviar was brilliant. Paired with fatty avocado and a refreshing cucumber-mint sauce? One of the best plates I think I've had, perhaps ever. I also really, really enjoyed the fried King Oyster Mushroom, which was texturally enjoyable.

Less exciting for me was the overreliance on lemongrass--it was in several dishes, which makes sense because lemongrass is delightful. But it was probably more than I needed. I also thought the grape mochi dessert was a flop. A bowl of grapes--just plain grapes, nothing particularly special about them--was served on ice at the same time as the mochi. The mochi itself, which was lovely, was wrapped in what I would describe basically as a grape fruit roll-up but with no sugar and covered in some weird white powdery substance. While the mochi itself was, as I said, something to savor, the odd mouthfeel and lack of flavor from the wrapper was a big swing and a big miss. I also didn't like the Sesame pretzel with chocolate. The texture was soft and fragile--not at all pretzel-y.

For drinks, I got the non-alcoholic pairing and it was fine but not great. Would not spend the money on it again--it was mostly just different grape juices. Not at all creative and diverse liked the non-alcoholic pairing at Atera. The final drink was some sort of dreadful and bitter non-alcoholic vermouth that I think everyone gets even if they don't do the pairing? Not good at all.

So, in sum--good meal, started extremely strong and maintained a pretty high consistency but was let down by disappointing desserts. I'd go again since I live within a 2-hour drive, but I don't think I'd suggest it for people who would have to travel farther than that. ",finedining
1734525501.0,Tokyo- Florilège (unusual dining experience) ,"Florilège is one of the dream fine dining destinations on my list when visiting Tokyo. Like others I went on their website one month in advance and managed to reserve two seats for our Tokyo trip this Dec. However, the overall dining experience fell short after the main dish (and if anyone knows why Florilège decides to serve their mains this way I would love to know) 

The restaurant is located in the new Azabudai Hills, and the setting is a huge communal style table where about 20+ people sit around the table and the chef is surrounded in the open kitchen in the middle. 

Their alcohol and non-alcohol pairing are priced reasonably, my wife and I were equally impressed with their pairing selections. There were about six pairings from start to main, and coffee/tea for dessert. 

The starters and appetizers were creative and very flavorful, focused on using seasonal vegetables including daikon, tomatoes, lotus roots, etc.

However, the dining experience took a turn when they started to serve the main dish. 

Our reservation was at 18:30pm, I believe there was an earlier round that started at around 18:00pm. There were two Japanese couple sitting across from us, and a few guests dine solo that started before us. When it was time to take photos of the main dish for the first round guests, the chef presented a plate with what looked like a huge rack of venison rib steak (we also see the chef basting the rack of ribs in butter during the preparation). However, when it was our time to take photos of the main, the chef showed us a pot with stewed oxtails in it. I mustve really enjoyed the appetizers and didn’t realize at that point we would have different mains, but turned out about 10+ people who ate one dish earlier than us had venison steak for mains, and we were served with a plate of stewed oxtail. 

Once realized we were served different mains, I was very confused and didn’t care much about the oxtail (I would argue if you spent the same at the restaurant, most people would choose steak over beef stew). This was a very odd experience, and I don’t think I have ever been in a fine dining restaurant with set menu that serves different mains. By the way, there wasn’t an option to choose the mains, it was assigned. 

Later when deserts were served, I did ask the waiter if they had different menus, and the explanation did not make much sense. So I didn’t bother to ask for more details. 

In hindsight, the experience would be different if we didn’t know what other guests were being served for mains, but when you saw other people were having steak first, then you were served with beef stew, it was a quite a let down….

To this day I still cannot find an explanation to explain why a two star Michelin restaurant would arrange two different mains, even though we paid the same for the same dinner set menu. Venison steak at that point seemed like a far superior choice for mains. 

Side note: Florilège presented the menu after the service, and while each dish is highlighted with the main ingredient used, the mains was conveniently noted as “To Balance”…",finedining

1734516041.0,"Osip 2.0 * Somerset, Uk","We recently went to Osip for a meal, the restaurant has been open in it's new format for about 3 months.

The inside is nice, I didn't visit the original premises but this space is nice and intimate, with the best table being at the end of a prep bench in the kitchen. Most of the tables are in the main dining room with a view of the open kitchen, however we were sat in a side room which did feel like the lesser of the two options. Chef Merlin Labron-Johnson was in during our visit and said hello as we were seated which was a nice touch.

The menu is tasting menu only with 3 additional options, which we opted for all: Lobster cooked over charcoal, Fallow deer and quail pithivier and a cheese course. The first two added 2 additional courses, while the cheese was a course on its own. The pithivier replaced a 'Pekin duck' dish as the most substantial course of the evening.

The meal started and ended in their 'lounge,' although this felt more like a waiting area, particularly at the end of the meal when we were moved out to allow a other seating to take place.

Pictures:
1: pre-dinner snacks served in the lounge, consisting of a cheese gougere and a candied walnut wrapped in crisp
2: root vegetable tea with burnt garlic oil, tempura parsnip, smoked eel in baby gem lettuce, purple daikon. The eel here was lovely, and I really enjoyed the dashi which was very umami
3: Beetroot taco, this was enjoyable but nothing amazing
4: a 'pear salad' on a base of whipped ricotta, again enjoyable but not a stand out
5: Jerusalem artichoke 'soup' with parsnip crisps and scallop tartare. This was an interesting mix of textures and flavours, as well as scallop there were some smaller pieces of chewy artichoke which added a nice edge to this dish.
6: Cornish monkfish - listed as sea bass on the menu given to us but I'm pretty sure it was described as monkfish when served and didnt have the texture of sea bass. This was nice, delicate and nothing particularly punchy
7: the second half of the lobster course. I missed a picture of the first part, which was a piece of lobster tail each grilled on charcoal. The part pictured here was more lobster served in a bisque which was presented in the tail shell. This was delicious, a very strong lobster flavour and very savoury bisque.
8: the bread course plus the first half of the pithivier dish. Beer and treacle bread with fallow deer belly and quail leg. This was nice bites, we both commented that it would have been nicer to have the bread earlier in the meal though
9: the deer and quail pithivier, with a peppercorn sauce (and a piece of something chewy which was delicious but I have no idea what it was). I enjoyed this pie, for me it lacked a bit of seasoning. There was also a 20-30 minute wait before pictures 7 and 8, I presume because the pie was cooked to order, but the wait wasn't explained before we ordered it which was a bit of a shame.
10: the cheese course, tunworth cheese on fruit break topped with truffle and honey from their bees. I really enjoyed this, a nice blend of salty and sweet. For me the cheese could have been punchier (I love English blue cheese, this would have been great here) but the course was tasty
11: crown prince pumpkin sorbet with pumpkin seed oil. A well made palate cleanser, nice smooth sorbet
12: the main dessert, a root vegetable ice cream with a linseed cracker on top and stone fruit inside. This was tasty, there was one very bitter fruit inside the ice cream which was a bit of shock when you caught a taste of it, but I didn't hate it
13: menu
14: on arrival

I didn't manage to get a picture of the final petit fours in the lounge, but they were a pistachio macaroni, a caramel chocolate and a madeleine.

Overall, we enjoyed the meal. The service was a little patchy, and the pacing of the meal fell off at parts. The most negative part was being moved from our table to the lounge for petit fours, but having to wait 15 minutes for a hot drink order to be taken and about 20-25 minutes for the petit fours to arrive. In my opinion at a restaurant of this level, if they are moving you to be seated elsewhere, everything should be ready to happen once you are moved.

Price-wise, it wasn't terrible value, the tasting menu is £125 pp, the lobster dish was £24pp, the pie was £50 shared and the cheese was £15pp. So it appears cheaper initially, but with the added courses it is about average.

I really liked their low waste ethos and farm to table approach, and you could see Labron-Johnson's cooking style throughout which I enjoyed.

Overall I would recommend but I wouldn't rush back myself as the experience didn't blow me away like I would hope from somewhere which is a ""destination"" restaurant.",finedining
1734515113.0,L'Enclume Wine Pairing Advice,"We're going to L'Enclume at the end of the week (excited!) and I just wondered if someone could share some wine knowledge because I'm fairly clueless.

After the recent post about the eye-wateringly priced wine pairings at Dinner by Heston, I realised I would be fairly susceptible to being ripped off on a wine flight (with googling the bottles and looking at prices being my only protection).

The wine list is posted here at the top of the page (I did try to copy the pairings over to this post but it's a bit of a nightmare to reformat for Reddit especially as I'm on my phone):

https://starwinelist.com/wine-place/l-enclume

I imagine they may not be exactly the same when we go but a useful guide nonetheless.

We like doing a flight because it's a nice way for two people who don't know a lot about wine to try different things, but I'm also not someone who can afford to be paying £100+ each on wine without a second thought about whether it's ""worth"" it.

I’m looking for some help brainstorming an experiential Christmas gift for my brother and his girlfriend (both live in the NYC area). We typically spend about $300-500 on each other, so there’s some room to play.

A bit about them:

* He’s really into comedy (loves stand-up shows).
* They’re both foodies, and she’s a vegetarian.
* They appreciate unique culinary experiences, fancy cocktails, and trying new things around the city.
* They love going out and experiencing cool, memorable date nights together.

I’m thinking of creating a sort of “Date Night in a Box” – maybe something like:

1. Tickets to a top-notch comedy show (e.g., Comedy Cellar or similar).
2. A gift certificate to a great vegetarian-friendly restaurant (Dirt Candy, Avant Garden, etc.).
3. A voucher for a cocktail-making class or a speakeasy experience afterward.

Before I lock this in, I’d love to hear any recommendations or unique ideas you might have. Maybe there’s a less obvious show they’d love, a quirky immersive experience, a really special vegetarian tasting menu, or a top-tier mixology class you’ve tried?

Any suggestions on how to make this gift more fun, personal, or adventurous would be super helpful! Thanks in advance!",finedining
1734407860.0,"Aquavit, ** NYC","For the third night in a row, I went to a Michelin-starred restaurant (last two nights: Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare and Atera) and for the third night in a row, I had a lovely night. (Note, I'm not insane--I'm just on a last minute work trip and decided to treat myself to places that still had solo spots available on short notice.) 

Aquavit was exciting because, unlike the last two places, it really demonstrated the individual personality of the Chef instead of just trying variations on high-class ingredients. The mulled wine, elk, and herring amuse bouche made me feel like I was in the fanciest viking party ever. Overall, the tastes here favor acids, fermentation, and heaviness/richness. Not a delicate meal in the slightest (take your toxically macho friends who are skeptical of fine food?)

For me, the menu started slow. The elk tartlet was fine, the warm mushroom broth was lovely if safe, and the herring cake tasted much more of onion than herring. Then, the salmon and trout roe dish was again fine but nothing to write home about. The dill sauce dominated over the fish, which was good but didn't seem especially elevated (it beggared negative comparison to the kampachi and dill crudo I had yesterday at Atera, an infinitely more elegant dish that's lingered in my head over the past day). So, good, but not stellar. The mulled wine was my favorite part so I was starting to worry.

But then, the night picked up when the glorious scallop with cauliflower came out. First, it's a huge portion. It had nice notes of brine and acid, and a roasted onion flavor overtone. Incredibly flavorful.

The caviar/langoustine was another standout. I liked it more and more as I ate it--especially when I got a mouthful of apples, which added a pleasing tartness. There was something smoky about the broth but I didn't catch what it was made of.

At this point, a gorgeous loaf of bread and butter was brought out. I ate half of it before I realized that it wasn't a standalone course and that I should save some for future juices. So good, though--crunchy crust, warm, dense and moist interior. The butter was whatever--not notable, although it was pretty. 

King Crab with meyer lemon sauce--lovely. The lemon was the hero of the dish, I think. Nice hefty portion of Crab though, and it was very tender.

Seas bass with fermented tomatoes--the broth again was the standout. The skin was crispy on the fish, which was good, and the fish was perfectly cooked--not overcooked at all even though the skin was crispy.

At this point, I was getting full (all the bread, I think) so I almost cried when I saw that the squab course was actually two plates--squab served two ways. I liked the main (rare breast meat with a fermented raspberry sauce) rather than the leg (which had, I think, some sort of mushroom something or other on it). Turns out, I do like squab--reminded me a bit of a really good quality duck but was less gamey. This was a heavy dish when I was already quite full, but honestly, I'm here for it.

Desserts: both splendid. Real standouts. The pumpkin sorbet was in lemon grass cream. Just sour enough, just sweet enough. Could've had more. Finally, the iconic Arctic Bird's Nest, the chef's signature dish. You can see why it made her famous--it's beautiful and beautifully well-conceived. Perfect blend of sweet and tart, soft and hard, crunchy and smooth.

Mignardises: fine. Nothing notable.

So, food wise, a slow start but after that it continued escalating and getting better and better until it finished with the glorious desserts. I left full, satisfied, and thoroughly impressed

Service: The service was okay. Not as good as what I've had at other 2* places, but generally fine. I had to ask to see the cocktail menu after I finished my mulled wine, instead of anyone asking if I needed a drink. And I felt slightly rushed toward the end (the mignardises were brought out before I finished my Bird's Nest). Not sure if they just wanted to turn the table since I was by myself? But honestly, it's fine. The food was so good that I'm not fussed about it! And I could tell they were all very busy and working hard. Perhaps they were short staffed tonight? ",finedining

It’s an amazing tasting menu that’s producer-focused and done using local ingredients (Niagara has an interesting microclimate that allows them to have great produce). The whole place is on a farm and the area is stunning overall.

But what honestly made this place stand out to me (which is surprising to say) is just how purely delicious everything was. I’ve been to some more produce-driven places that honestly are interesting experiences, but aren’t necessarily the most delicious. RPM hits a perfect balance of flavor and philosophy that I think is pretty rare nowadays. 

A few highlights from the menu/pictures shown:

* Carrot crisp with scallop and lobster roe, ginger, and dried chili 
* Melons compressed in jalapeno syrup and rhubarb juice
* Farm eggs with toasted hay and sweet corn custard, sabayon, and wild Acadian caviar
* Butter poached Abundance potatoes with caramelized cream, smoked egg, fried onion, and potato crumble
* Marinated strawberries and sake lees mousse with shiso and rice cooked in sweetgrass
* Slow grilled halibut with beurre monte, pickled kohlrabi and gooseberry with onion puree
* Grilled pork with sweet corn puree, chanterelle mushrooms, sunflower oil, and prickly ash
* Lobster with sweet onion glaze, onion mousse, nectarines, lovage puree and lemon balm

1734391044.0,"Cariño (*) Chicago, IL ","Last night was my second trip to Cariño, the first one being during July 2024 thanks to the number of people on /r/Chicagofood raving about it during the first few months of operation. 

We sat at the chefs counter, which is about 210 per person in advance of any wine pairing. We skipped the pairing as we were big fans of the cocktails. 

The menu was primarily the same as my first trip, which is no complaints from me - - I figure if they expect to have a bump in people through the door due to their new star they should be firing on all cylinders. New to this meal VS our last (standard dining room menu) was the perigord truffle quesadilla and the pineapple coconut tepache dessert, both of which were good additions/swaps. Last trip there was a sweetbreads course with a powdered banana that I wasn't a huge fan of. 

One thing that I love about Cariño that I haven't had at other stars here in Chicago was the emphasis on acidity and heat. Frequently found in the first few courses were things like chili and lime juice - both were lovely and well balanced.

The menu (as I remember it)

Chips and Salsa - Salsa Verde gelee on a bed of crushed corn chips - as you throw this single bite back and chew it goes from foreign to familiar - exactly like dipping a corn chip into a tomatillo salsa. 

Chicarron with an esquite foam - dusted with BBQ powder and served with a lime wedge, this is something I wish I could make at home as it's a great snack. 

Michelada inspired Oyster - a single oyster with a michelada foam, tajin rim and clamato pearls. 

Aguachile - the menu online says this has Ora king salmon, cucumber and jalapeño but the number of pleasant textures and flavors present in this dish were really pleasant to me. I had forgotten how much I enjoyed this my first meal! 

Huitlacoche Ravioli - one of my picks for the prettiest plates I've eaten, this is Huitlacoche (corn smut) sweet corn, and truffle. Corn is present in cooked, freeze dried, and popped form as well in the fried corn silks that surround the corn foam. This ranks highly in best bites I've had this year. 

Taco Trio - tacos dorados w/ chicken liver and adobo / crab empanada with gooseberry and habanero / lamb Al pastor tostada with pineapple - the crab was new for us this trip, as the previous meal had a blue masa taco that I cannot fully recall. This is a fun showing of the house masa that is found in a few places on this menu and is perhaps more broadly shown on Chef Norman Fenton's Taco Omakase, which has seating most nights a week at 10pm. I enjoyed all three presentations of the tacos, and we were encouraged to eat from left to right. 

Truffle Quesadilla - one of the fun parts of this meal was watching the chef and his supporting team pace out each course - and one thing that I noted with this one specifically was the speed and simplicity with which it was whipped up. Things like the Aguachile and the oyster were a display of process, of order and perfectionism, whereas this course came together in a few minutes, with Oaxacan cheese and black garlic quesadillas hitting the stove and mere moments later hitting our plates, adorned with a small mountain of grated truffle. 

Black Cod - I really loved the fried mustard leaf that topped this dish, hiding the fish and mole Amarillo underneath. This was hit with a bit of smoke that I recall was the sap of a specific tree located in Mexico (sorry chef, I tried to keep up!) which added a pleasant aroma and fun presentation. 

Lamb - big fan of the combination of lamb and beet here, this was a great combination of earthy and fatty flavors from the red lamb. The beet in several forms adds a fun touch as well while never letting up on that beet flavor. 

Mangonada riff - I was thrilled to eat this again, and would gladly eat 4-5 portions of this myself if given the opportunity. The combination of the mango, lemon balm, strawberry chamoy and sour candy beneath made for a sweet/savory acidic bite that contrasted the rich course before it. Great palate cleanser. 

Pineapple Coconut Tepache - this was a cute donut shaped dessert, topped with a pineapple sorbet/ice cream with tepache orbs. Something in this dish had a distinct fizz to it, which made each bite a little different.

Chocolate Ganache Ribbon with Hoja Santa ice cream - the green leaf that was a garnish on several of the other plates of the night was now the star, as an herbacious and peppery ice cream paired with sweet goodies in the form of bendable chocolate Ganache, macerated blueberries, dulce de Leche pearls creates a choose-your-own adventure which caps the menu off. 

All in all, I had another good meal here and hope to attend again for one of the tacos with friends nights, where the chef invites a chef from another Chicago restaurant to riff, the invitee proposes 6 courses and Norman and team come up with a complimentary batch of courses. December had Zach Engel of Galit, January will be with Adam McFarland and Thomas Roger's of John's Food and Wine, February will be with Sujan Sarkar of Indienne, and March will be with Michael Carlson of Schwa.

1734319973.0,"Atera, ** NYC","Day 2 of my solo dining journey through New York (last night was Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare) took me to Atera. I didn't really know much about this place and just booked them because this trip was last minute and they had a solo seat open. I was worried after reading a negative review (https://www.reddit.com/r/finedining/s/VJtYt5j9Q0)  from a few weeks ago. But, I'll happily say that I don't agree with it at all--I thought this was an excellent restaurant. Better, even, than Chef's Table if for no reason other than it emphasized umami and acidity, which I prefer. 

Highlights: 
*The Kaulga Caviar dish, served over a custard with smoked olive oil. Ungodly amounts of Caviar, which I loved, but the real winner for me was the smoked olive oil. Unreal flavor profile that infused every bite. 

*The ""Pork"" dish (as it's listed on the menu). The server described this as a ""corn cappuccino"" and it is truly one of the strangest, most creative things I've ever eaten. Shrimp broth, tons of iberico, saffron mushroom ravioli, tomato, and corn of course. It's a weird combination of flavors that I was living for. Every bite was an adventure.

*Wagyu: Nice, perfectly cooked portion of wagyu with a gorgeous harissa paste and truffle broth. The most punch-you-in-the-face set of flavors of the night. It was served with some weird lettuce and brussels sprouts thing that didn't fully make sense, but the server encouraged me to alternate bites of wagyu and lettuce. It was a good choice--the lettuce offset the intensity of the truffle broth/wagyu. But, I don't know that the lettuce thing is fully realized yet (I'm a teacher and to me it felt like the first draft of a really promising student's final. Signs of brilliance but not quite there). But it doesn't really matter--the hero of the dish is the meat and that broth. I can't get enough of them.

Lowlights: 
none with the food, although I thought the decision to include both scallop and halibut in the Halibut dish (which was excellent) was curious. I would've just as soon had extra halibut. 

As a solo diner, I was placed next to someone else solo and sometimes both of our meals were brought out at the same time and explained to both of us, as if we were a couple. I initially found this off-putting (especially since this guy really didn't seem like he wanted to talk), but it's fine. I guess it makes more sense than having the servers waste time repeating themselves. 

The real lowlight? The bathroom smelled badly of urine. That was gross.

Temperance pairing: I'm not a huge drinker, so I opted for the non-alcoholic Temperance Pairing and I really enjoyed it. I wish more restaurants had this! Each was delicious, and each complemented the food. Strong flavors!

1734317641.0,Wine Pairing Recommendations for Spain Trip,"Hi everyone,

I'm planning a culinary trip to Spain next year, focusing on the best restaurants outside the northwestern region due to time constraints. This includes many 3-star Michelin restaurants and other highly-rated establishments.

I enjoy wine pairings that enhance a meal, but I'm not a heavy drinker. Consuming more than 6 glasses of wine in a two-hour meal can be overwhelming. As I'm not a wine expert, navigating wine lists can be challenging.

I'm looking for recommendations of a few fine dining restaurants in Spain that offer exceptional wine pairings. I'd like to avoid excessive alcohol consumption over the course of the entire trip. I'm not interested in wines that are excellent on their own or overly expensive lists. Instead, I'm seeking pairings that truly complement the food and elevate the overall dining experience.

Thanks for your advice!

1734295975.0,Wine pairing markup?,"I went out to Dinner by Heston in London with my wife last night. The food was great, particularly the meat fruit and the tipsy cake. We treated ourselves to their “classic” wine pairing which included a glass of wine with each course of the tasting menu (4 courses). We enjoyed the meal, but I wasn’t particularly blown away by the wines and have since looked up the bottles that we were served. The four wines can be bought at retail in the UK for £11, £30, £19, and £30. We were given a small glass of each, and the red with the main was topped up, say 5 small glasses each so generously about a bottle of wine each. At retail that’s £22.5 worth of wine each. For this we were charged £195 each plus service - that’s a 10x markup on retail! Is this normal?",finedining

1734283012.0,"Frog by Adam Handling, London (1*)","We visited London for a few days and managed to snag a late reservation here! It was an amazing experience and one of my favorite meals to date. The staff was warm and friendly, the service was outstanding, and the food was to die for. We spent £691.70 for two tasting menus, two non-alcoholic drink pairings, and one £65 glass of champagne. The drink pairings were beautifully balanced and complimented the food better than I ever imagined.

Unfortunately, I forgot to take a picture of my favorite dish, which really bums me out. Oh well.

I can't recommend Frog enough. If you are able to come here, you should!

Slide 1-3: we were seated initially at a table because the bar was full, and we were greeted by a card explaining where the ingredients come from and a menu/ drink pairings menu with costs. After being poured water and champagne, the bar opened up and we were moved.

Slide 4: beef tea with thyme (absolutely divine, I could drink another 5 glasses of this. It's like beef stock but richer)

Slide 5: cured cod belly ceviche mousse on a biscuit (so rich yet refreshing, and you could really taste the lime)

Slide 6: cheese and onion crisp on a buckwheat cracker with cheese

Slide 7: duck sausage with brown sauce

Slide 8: chicken sandwich (this was phenomenal, it had the richness of duck but tasted like the juiciest chicken thigh you've ever eaten)

Slide 9-10: chicken skin butter and chicken pate with gravy (their signature dish - it was amazing)

They explained at this point in the meal that this was the end of the beginning snacks, and we were now on to the main dishes; the snacks we had made use of the byproducts of our main meal. I really appreciated the emphasis they put on not wasting any food.

Slide 11: brown crab, herb stalks and radish with herb sauce (they pulled a bottle of green sauce out of the plant sitting next to us and finished the dish in front of us with this sauce! It was unexpected and funny.)

Slide 12: lobster aged in wagyu fat, finished on the grill (oh my god. This is the best lobster I've ever eaten. It was rich, tender, a little funky, salty, and just outstanding.)

Slide 13: wagyu meat, lobster crisp (this was a little unbalanced, almost too salty and you couldn't really detect the wagyu - the texture was amazing and I'm pretty sure it had truffle shavings on it.)

Nonexistent slide: unfortunately, we forgot to take a picture of our favorite dish. It was cod with green chili, grapes, and caramelized whey. I cannot stress to you how amazing this dish was. The cod was tender, the whey was sweet and creamy, the grapes were peeled and added sometartness, the chili added a fresh note. In my opinion, this dish made the entire meal.

Slide 14: duck, black pudding, turnip puree and mushroom ketchup with lingonberry gravy (very rich. I was uncertain about the black pudding, but after trying it I am a changed woman! It was sweet and earthy. Apparently I forgot to take a picture after they poured the gravy on it, because I suck. Lol)

Slide 15: parsley ice cream with hibiscus and grape seed oil (a palate cleanser. I am not a huge fan of parsley as a main flavor but the hibiscus was strong enough that unless you ate just the ice cream it didn't taste overwhelmingly of parsley.)

Slide 16: apple pie, custard, woodruff (amazing. The textures were interesting)

Slide 17: praline egg, grapefruit and rosemary jelly, sea buckthorn tart, chocolate hazelnut and grape jelly (I wasn't a huge fan of these - the flavors were very strong and they were very sweet. In no way am I complaining about it, just not for me.)

Slide 18: take home menu for the night

Slide 19-20: a take home goody basket with a roll and a generous helping of their chicken butter. It was a great way to end the experience the next morning.",finedining
1734271730.0,Xiquet* DC & El Chato #25 Collaboration,"This meal was a collaborative effort between Xiquet’s Danny Lledo (Washington, DC) and El Chato’s Alvaro Clavijo (Bogota, Colombia). It was a delightful experience to witness how they divided the dishes between them, showcasing their unique culinary styles. Each chef brought their own distinct approach to the dishes, making the meal an exciting and enjoyable journey. Most of the dishes were original creations, not just rehashes of their standard menus.  


ACT I - CHEF DANNY: CUCURUCHO
A light and flavorful start. The combination of corn, golden beets, and manchego espuma feels like an elegant amuse-bouche, teasing the palate with a delicate balance of sweetness and umami.

ACT II - CHEF DANNY: TRITURA ESPAÑOLA, MOJAMA, TARTLET
The trio here adds complexity:
	•	Tritura Española impresses with a creamy, egg-based foundation and the smoky Iberico.
	•	Mojama shines with the savory shaved tuna and tangy tomato compote.
	•	Tartlet is refreshing, with citrus and tuna harmonizing perfectly.

ACT III - CHEF ALVARO: GUAYABA
A creative mix of guava and cheese with cassava and black garlic. The tropical sweetness pairs well with the savory elements, offering bold contrasts.

ACT IV - CHEF ALVARO: OSTION
The oyster with shiso and gutila is clean and briny, enhanced by herbal and delicate flavors. A standout for seafood lovers.

ACT V - CHEF ALVARO: TARTARE DE RES
A robust and savory beef tartare paired with jicama provides a refreshing crunch. The bold beef heart adds a deeper flavor note.

ACT VI - CHEF DANNY: LLOBORADO
The seabass is beautifully cooked, flaky, and tender. The fennel pollen and orange-saffron butter lend a floral, citrusy richness that elevates the dish.

ACT VII - CHEF DANNY: ARRÓS DEL CARABINER
An exceptional dish with luxurious ingredients. The Alicante paella is flavorful and rich, with the carabinero prawn and ossetra caviar delivering opulence and umami.

ACT VIII - CHEF ALVARO: LENGUA DE AXI
A bold and hearty tongue dish with green peppercorns and zucchini. The smokiness of the jus complements the tender texture of the meat.

ACT IX - CHEF DANNY: IBERICO WELLINGTON
A refined twist on the classic. The Iberico pork tenderloin is perfectly executed, with the flaky brioche crust and Iberico ham adding layers of richness. The jus ties it together beautifully.

ACT X - CHEF ALVARO: MAMBE
A unique palate cleanser or light dish, with kumis (fermented milk) and fennel. It refreshes and surprises with its earthy, tangy notes.

ACT XI - CHEF ALVARO: CURABA
The chalupa with black lime offers a crisp, smoky bite. The lime adds depth and brightness to balance the rich flavors.

ACT XII - CHEF DANNY: PASTIS DE CARLOTA I FORMATGE
The dessert is indulgent yet balanced, with creamy cheese notes and a refreshing orange-carrot sorbet that cleanses the palate.

ACT XIII - CHEF DANNY: ROSCON DE REYES
A celebratory dish with layers of citrus and almond flavors. The rum syrup adds a festive warmth, pairing nicely with the tea service.

ACT XIV - CHEF DANNY: MIGNARDISES
A delightful ending featuring small, sweet bites:
	•	Pâte de Fruits offers a chewy, fruity burst.
	•	Bonbon is rich and satisfying.
	•	Mazapan brings a nostalgic almond sweetness.
	•	Turrón d’Alacant and Turrón de Xixona showcase the classic Spanish nougat textures, ending the meal on a refined, traditional note.

1734253824.0,"Hiša Denk ⭐️ Zgornja Kungota, Slovenia","Hiša Denk is located around a ~20 minute drive from Maribor, Slovenia, and was one of the best dining experiences I’ve had in this country! The head chef comes to greet everyone at the start and is quite eccentric, which is a welcome change from the typically reserved personalities at fine dining establishments. We told him we were from Australia and he said “OK screw the menu, we cook you kangaroo. Medium? Rare?”

As for the dining experience, it felt so complete; like it perfectly built up to a climactic point and finished just when we couldn’t have any more. The dishes were all presented so elegantly and we were particularly taken even by the design of the plates, tables, and the room at large (My dining buddy is an architect and couldn’t stop going on about his amazement with the space). 

Now for some of the dishes of note, “Pigeon, 3 times” as the waiter described it, with a pigeon breast, pigeon pâté tart, and a pigeon terrine cube. Pigeon meat itself has quite a peculiar iron flavour, but the way each of these complemented each other was fantastic. The cod was a consensus favourite for us though, which is the one with the black fish bone crisp atop it and served on the glass bowl. So many layers and interweaving flavours (even a rich risotto packed underneath the purees, sauces, and emulsions) that honestly stole the show away from the red meat dishes (which I usually am far more impartial to). The amuse bouche was actually a highlight for both of us, each item packed with so much flavour that it jump started our taste buds up and made us super excited to continue. Mangalica pork ‘taco’, smoked trout and mussel bite, a goose liver cherry, and a beef tartare mini tart - I could have honestly just eaten about 3-4 of each of these and called it a night. 

Honestly one of the best ‘value’ fine dining I’ve ever had, with the pricing structure offering 7 courses for €100 (with cheaper options for less courses), also with a healthy repertoire of amuse bouche and petit fours to close. Highly recommend if you are travelling through!

1734237703.0,"Chef’s Table at Brooklyn Fare, ** NYC","Had a really lovely night at Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare. It's kind of fun entering a two-star Michelin restaurant by walking through a random Hell's Kitchen grocery store. I was by myself, and they sat me at the bar next to someone else who was also eating solo, which was kind of thoughtful and, presumably, practical.

Sitting at the counter gave me a good view of everything going on--as the night became busier, I found myself entranced, almost hypnotized by how 15+ employees all multi-tasking didn't regularly crash into one another despite navigating a fairly small place. I was also impressed to see that the two chefs were involved in all aspects of food production--shaving truffles, spooning caviar, tweezing microgreens--and not just the major proteins. They also bused plates to customers a handful of times. I get the impression that everyone is responsible for all aspects of the evening. 

The food was excellent. Not a bad dish among them. Overall, I found them to be an exploration in the relationship between sweet and savory. There weren't a ton of overly acidic dishes, nor salty dishes, but they were all flavorful and made productive use of contrasts. 

Two dishes I was afraid of before going--the wagyu tartar and the abalone--ended up being really good. I'm not a fan of beef tartar in general, and worried that fatty wagyu would give me the textual ick. It still kind of did for the first quarter second, but the brilliant flavor of the romesco sauce in the meat made me get over it. The abalone, which is served in a pool of liver sauce, sounded frankly gross to me, and I'd heard that abalone could be chewy--but it wasn't at all. I found it to be delicate and sweet.


Some standouts:
Blue Fin Tuna: one bite, textually interesting. The delicate potato shell tasted almost like what a Michelin-starred Pringle might taste like. Worked beautifully against the fatty tuna.

Foie Gras/Eel: delightfully smoky! I'm team more smoky flavors in fine dining.

Wild Buri: Masterpieces of a dish. Basically a ceviche, I guess? With trout roe, fingerlime sauce, and shiso oil. Vinegary-y, minty, textually fascinating. Shockingly large portion too.

Turbot and King Crab: the fish were fine, but the saffron sauce was the standout. I'll think about it for a while.

Duck: A genius way to end the night. After so many sweet and heavy sauces, the au jus here just let the duck showcase itself. Fatty, mild, and delicious, it almost tasted like the thanksgiving dinner of your dreams. 

If I wanted to split hairs and complain, I'd say:
*The ""signature"" Hokkaido Uni on Waffle dish was just fine. Probably one of the least exciting of the night. Still good, mind you, but it felt unresolved somehow. Maybe the waffle is a touch too thick? Or it needs to be soaked in maple syrup (I think there was some but it got buried by the mounds of uni)? If I'm not mistaken, this dish is a version of the old Chef's dish, but I think it might still need some work. The truffles, though. Omg those truffles. [The truffles were so aromatic that you could smell them being sliced from across the room]. 

*I'd sear the diver scallops for maybe 30 seconds more.

but these really are just splitting hairs. Delightful meal! Much deserving of its two stars",finedining

I’m kind of over the 3-star scene (or 3-star wannabe places); in the last year, I was generally disappointed with Noma, Single Thread and Geranium (would also include Jont in this group); Frantzen would be the exception. Some of my favorites dining experiences have been Oriole, Manresa (when 2-star), Atomix (before any stars), Jua, and Castagna (rip).

1734204856.0,"é by Jose Andres(not starred, Feb 2020)","So I finally got to dine at e, and what an experience it was! They call it the ""show"" on your Golden Ticket, and after enjoying the 2+ hour spectacle, I have to agree.

There are too many dishes to go in detail for each one, but I'll hit the highlights and personal favorites:

""Stone"" cheese coated in rosemary oil and jamon Iberica fat. Rich, creamy, and decadent all the way around.

Wonder Bread: I'm not going to ruin the surprise, but one of the hits of the night.
(OK, I'll ruin it: the 'bread' was blowtorch toasted apple meringue, spread with foie gras, and topped with fresh persimmon and a healthy dose of fresh black truffle)

Esparragos Escabeche: asparagus, white asparagus foam, egg yolks and caviar.

Edible Sangria: Liquid nitrogen cooled spheres of Sangria, dropped carefully into a vertically cut wine bottle.

Txangurro a la Donastiarra: Dungeness crab with a spanish soffits and bread crumb

Foie Royale: foie gras, truffle. Pure, silky, rich deliciousness. I said this about a lot of dishes, but I could have done 20 courses of this dish alone.

Empanada: cotton candy empanada with foie gras and corn nuts. You would not imagine that combination as one of the greatest bites of your life, but it is.

Fricando: cut with a fork tender. There was a murmur that ran through the table when the dish was announced, and rightfully so. The Austrailian Wagyu had just enough heft to feel like you were eating a steak a la USDA Prime, but it melted in the mouth like A5.

I also have to mention my tablemates. A dinner such as this has the opportunity to be an exercise in pretentiousness. Fortunately, I was in good company with a birthday party of 8. Matt, Todd, everyone, if any of you ever read this, thank you for making a memorable night welcoming as well.

Overall, e is simply an experience you must enjoy at least once in your Las Vegas life. It is worth every second of your time, every cent of the final bill.

1734203033.0,"Sazenka ***, Tokyo","This was easily my favorite meal of 2025 (and one of my top meals of all time) and is the restaurant that I’d recommend to every single person here 😤

Sazenka hits the perfect balance between elevating Chinese cuisine while still keeping it true to its cultural identity. It’s very clearly not a Western tasting menu which I think makes it all the more interesting. The way they play with spice, flavor, and specifically texture is unlike any other fine dining restaurant I’ve been to! 

A few highlights:

* The Buddha Jump Soup includes a mix of a ton of odd ingredients like brown bear meat, crocodile, deer horn, etc. (you don’t eat any of them, they’re just to flavor the broth), but it’s one of the most complex flavors in what is seemingly a simple broth

* Their eggplant and pork dish is sublime. It’s sliced so thinly that it almost just melts in your mouth and the fattiness from the pork and the almost creaminess from the eggplant is a perfect combo

* They had three preparations of pufferfish, one in a char siu style, one that’s braised, and one that’s served under a bed of chilis — all three were phenomenal, but the char siu version that you eat like a rib was so unique

* Lastly, they had a few very simple dishes like their mapo tofu. It came at the very end of the savories and we were already stuffed but couldn’t resist downing that entire bowl because it was just so well executed and homey

Overall, I had high expectations going in, but was still completely blown away by the quality, refinement, and flavor of Sazenka — I genuinely can’t recommend this place enough and it should be at the top of all of your lists of places to visit ❤️",finedining

TL;DR - I hadn't even heard of this place or it's predecessor, but read a review last week so had to give it a try.  They feature local, seasonal ingredients.  Pricing is very moderate for San Francisco, $130 for the 5-course tasting menu or you can order a la carte as we did.  I found the food to be meticulously prepared and every dish with layered flavors.  Our favorites were the uni noodle dish with lobster-uni foam/broth, the abalone with an abalone liver sauce (hey we love sauces), and the kale with sesame dressing, but really every dish was delicious and well prepared, just some more so.  The only ""miss"" I would say was the white truffle from Alba that we added to the uni dish as a supplement - they had their truffle shaver set too thick and the truffle wasn't that aromatic at all (we should have asked to inspect the truffle beforehand...).  Overall though, I really thought that this place was a hidden gem, so much so that I'm almost reluctant to post about it here lest it become so popular and I have difficulty getting reservations here next time.

1734094982.0,"Sushi Wadatsumi*, Hong Kong","Decided to try Wadatsumi as lunch seemed reasonable for a * and compared to other sushiyas. Kowloon: Udatsu (new, replaces Araki), Tokami. Island side: Shikon, Saito, Fujimoto.

There are two counters, we were seated with Chef Man. Chef is friendly, welcoming, easy-going, was mostly us chatting to him, accommodated our requests with no fuss. 12:30 start, 1 seating, plenty of time for add-ons since there's no rush for a 2nd seating.

Funny story about couple next to us. Chef served one as the other went to the bathroom. Diner was soo patient, he waited until his companion came back 5m later to eat it. Sacrilege! Though if this were a Chinese family meal setting, we might be commending him for his table manners. 

**Service:**

Service staff were on point. Super attentive clearing plates, re-filling tea. I'm ambidextrous. Started the meal with chopsticks right handed, tea, chopsticks, gari were switched seemlessly to my left as soon as I used my left hand. Polite, no attitude. 

**Food:**

\+chawanmushi, crab, roe. Sweet, fragrant. Fits my tastes.

\+smoked katsuo, smoke usually doesn't do much flavorwise for me (regardless of Western/ Chinese/ Japanese cuisine), more often than not, just an aromatic effect. However, the smoke came through here flavorwise.

\+hokkigai, am not the biggest fan of hokkigai and torigai, among the clams, I find them chewy and rubbery. I prefer akagai, tairagai, hotate, for their crunchy, firm, meaty textures. However, chef lightly seared the hokkigai, texture became less chewy and brought out more sweetness.

\+anago, not a fan of boiled anago due to mushy texture. This was crispy/ crunchy. Suits my tastes more. 

\~tamago, texture and taste reminded me of pumpkin pie. 

Nodoguro was substituted for hokkigai allergy. Looked good, so did an add-on.

**Recommendations?**

In fact, I’d even say the desserts by pastry chef Erika Chan (also formerly of Rustic Canyon) were my main highlights of the meal.

That being said, some dishes and flavors seemed a little too austere like the pork loin and sweet potato dishes, both of which needed a pop of interest.  Thinking back on it now, I get the feeling that they’re still figuring out what the space and people dining there want and balancing that with what and how they want to cook.

1733993855.0,Unpopular Opinion - I hated Per Se,"I went about a year ago but I saw a post on this sub recently and got fired up again by how bad my experience was. I went with a handful of friends and we did the tasting + foie gras supplement + wine pairing. 

This isn't particularly the fault of anyone involved, but it's a remarkably unsexy experience when you have to search around a mall to find the restaurant. I've been to lesser-starred places (shoutout Quintonil in CDMX) that literally greeted you street-side to escort you to the restaurant so there are definitely ways they could mitigate this. Certainly when you're paying $1k per head it doesn't seem unreasonably to ask.

There were some courses that were simply inexcusable for the caliber of restaurant. I'm attaching one here as an example. It is a single spear of asparagus next to a potato next to a congealed piece of chicken. I truly cannot believe this dish of food was served at a 3\* restaurant. 

  
There was a bread course with the most delicious rolls and I asked if they could bring more and was greeted with the strangest reaction - I would have been happy to pay for them but I certainly didn't think it was insane to ask. 

Overall it was the lowest quality to dollar ratio I've experienced in a restaurant. We all got Taco Bell afterwards.

1733956556.0,Ginza Fukuju (Tokyo) (**) (November 2024),"There is something effortlessly cool and free-spirited about Ginza Fukuju's approach to cooking. The chef isn't too concerned when some jelly in the snow crab dish (matsuba-gani) spills over; all that matters is the inherent flavour of the female crab, which is impeccable, its orange roe glistening gloriously and crunching delightfully in the mouth. Later, a cooked version revolving around a male crab proves equally enchanting, the sweet strands of meat releasing their essence into the dazzling dashi.   

Each dish features one star ingredient, which is allowed to shine without much adornment. No long-winded narratives are needed because the ingredients speak for themselves. Portions are arguably huge by fine-dining standards, with the exception of a tiny tea pot filled with yuzu-scented suppon soup. The clear broth boasts remarkable depths and offers sheer comfort given the freezing weather. 

The treatment of fugu, that potentially fatal fish prized for its bouncy texture, is the best I have encountered - its flesh and skin are mixed with seaweed, shiso flowers and ponzu sauce, so every bite is a refreshing delight. Omi beef, which comes with its A5 certificate, is prepared sukiyaki-styled, its fat shimmering when each slice is dipped in the egg yolk sauce, the shavings of truffle scattered over the beef adding a touch of luxury. Intensely marbled otoro, crunchy cabbage pickles and a miso soup replete with tiny clams form a stellar cast in the rice course.

The theme of minimalism continues in the dessert, which showcases a mellow, juicy persimmon in an ode to autumn. The drink is prepared with skill, too, the ice accompanying the umeshu a sphere of intricate patterns that shines beautifully. Interestingly, I am given rice as a take-home gift for the second time in a row this Japan trip. I wonder if this is part of a campaign to promote Japan's precious grains. ",finedining

1733828279.0,Hawksworth - Vancouver,"(Repost because the formatting was hurting my soul)

This is my first review on this sub, I've posted a lot in other spaces but have just discovered this place recently ... please be kind, I'm by no means a professional food critic, just a fine dining (and food in general) aficionado who likes to write). Also for this reason sorry for the massive wall of text this will end up being

My visit at the Hawksworth tonight was pretty much a spur of the moment, I was walking downtown trying to decide where to eat and I saw the tasting menu of Hawksworth had a few interesting dishes and a reasonable price so I decided to hop in. Despite being a walk in the staff was very fast in finding me a table (during a fairly busy service) and all where personable & efficient, however (as I will discuss below) the service itself had quite a few hiccups.

Now to the review proper:

The Restaurant: Opened in 2011 at the Rosewood Hotel, winning 2012 & 2013 Restaurant of the Year, recently entered the short list of Michelin recommended restaurants in Canada but stopped shy of a star

The Chefs: David Hawksworth is a fundamentally BC chef, living and cooking in the territory since the 2000s and being the province's youngest chef ever inducted in the BC hall of fame. He works at (and owns) Hawksworth & The Nightingale and is a strong proponent of farm to table and BC inspired flavors. While he designs all the menus at Hawksworth tonight's service was helmed by executive chef Sylvain Assie & Marissa Flores Gonzalez the pastry chef who made the Rosewood Hotel famous for its Macaron flights

What I Ordered: Winter 2024 Chef's Menu + 1 Cocktail, 1 Water and Wine Pairing on the 3rd Course only
(Didn't want to drink, or spend on wine, too much but pairings are available for all dishes)

What I Paid: 99 Canadian for the menu 166 Canadian total with drinks, tip & taxes

What I Got:

Hibiscus Whisper:
A nice cocktail to start the night, the bartender actually came to the table to ask me my preferences and suggest a cocktail after I ordered the tasting menu and said I was interested in something to drink first. He guided me toward a good, if a bit too boozy for me, pick at a very reasonable price, which paired well with the starter. Also I appreciated being asked if I preferred to have the cocktail while waiting or with my first course.

First Course: Albacore Tuna
High quality local ingredients served simply go a long way. The inclusion of Kohirabi is inspired as its a less utilized vegetable which is actually grown in large quantities in BC and exemplifies the chef's philosophy in highlighting local ingredients while winking at broader inspirations from Europe to Asia. It also serve double duty in the dish as a counterpoint to tuna & ponzu broth both in texture and flavor elevating the dish from what could have been quite one note.

Second Course: Striped Sea Bass
Keeping on the BC theme a dish that utilizes only locally caught or foraged ingredients. Wrapping the Sea Bass in butternut squash again pulls double duty in this dish. On the texture front it provides again a counterpoint to a fish that almost melts in your mouth. While on an aesthetic note intentionally evokes the flag of BC itself when laying flat on the dish (my picture does not do it justice but I noticed the link in person). Its a nice playful dish served with a delicious broth that I was too polite to slurp all like I would have wanted

Intermezzo: Granita
It was a pretty good palate freshener to separate the fish dishes from the upcoming meat, to be honest wholly unnecessary but not unwelcome

Third Course: Fraser Valley Duck Breast
The standout of the dinner, much appreciated the variety of textures between the duck's skin and interior and once again truly respect the BC specific touches. Both the McIntosh Apple and the Le Bourgeot Quince are a wonderfully nerdy historical touch. Not only they are locally sourced but McIntosh and duck is a known pairing in the Canadian colonies since the 1800s and Quince might date to even earlier appearing in surveys in Alberta as early as the 1600s and in menus in BC from the 1890s onward. Shame for the brussels sprouts which don't seem to have any cohesion to the rest of the dish and seem to be there just to give the color green a cameo in this dinner service

Fourth Course: Sunchoke & Birch Icecream
I don't have a refined palate for desserts personally but this hit a lot of interesting notes. The suggestion to try the icecream alone and then with each of the ingredients from inside to outside and to finish with a bite of everything together was an inspired one and I have to thank the waiter for making sure I got to explore each of the flavor pairing on the plate. Once again most of the ingredients 80% overall I believe the waiter said, are sourced from local allotments. There is some interesting ideas but I found the plating a bit boring

Fifth Course: Sweets
Its a typical presentation for the Hawksworth but it works better with their signature Macarons, which I was sad not to see in tonight's offering. That said each bite was quite good and a nice way to finish the dinner

Wine Pairing: A bit on the cheap side as a bottle for what was charged by the glass (even for fine dining standards) but a decent companion for the duck. I remain convinced of the correctness in skipping the wine pairing with the rest of the mean, though I would have probably asked the bar to propose me a cocktail to go with the Third Course if I had the foresight to do so.

Service: Excellent about 80%, with some major slip ups.
First was with the cutlery for my second course. While all other cutlery was pretty much shiny as a mirror my knight seemed a bit rough, I asked if there was an issue with it and it was replace without a comment.
Secondly was after the 3rd course, once I finished my wine both my wine and water glass where taken away despite my water bottle being still half full. I told my waiter but it was only replaced by the time the course itself was almost over.
Finally during the presentation of the menu I was told there was an option to add their in house bread and compound butter, which I selected but was never brought to me (I was not charged for this, but I realized it was not coming by the time my second course was on the way so I just decided to skip it).
Despite these issues the head waiter was a gent; kind, competent and knowledgeable. On top of that, when I had some problem with the bill (credit card was not working, turned out to be a machine issue) he was very quick to fix the problem and attentive to assuage my worries, especially when I initially thought my card had been rejected

Conclusion: Hawksworth confirms itself a decent choice for a moderately upscale evening with an inspired chef with clever ideas but struggles to stick the landing in many aspects. I'm not surprised it failed to gain its Star in 2022 but would also not be surprised if Chef Hawksworth himself will win one next time around; though probably for his other project (Nightingale) with its trendy farm to table concept tasting menu. The food is always good to great and deliciously nerdy for someone interested in BC history but I can't but wish the service got the same level of attention because tonight was lacking (despite the best efforts of a wonderful head waiter, front desk staff and bartender who really put their all into the service). For now its another near miss (or near hit, if you are a more positive person than me) for downtown Vancouver",finedining

1733798420.0,Realistic Tokyo Reservation Guide - 2025 (I will report back for each establishment),"Basically, this post will be dedicated for average diners (without clout) on getting reservations. (Mostly following steps/tips/timing to get reso.)

Also, this can be serve as a guide for which restaurant to head to! (Mainly using Tabelog or Michelin guide)

Upcoming Tokyo trip:

1. Den (Modern Kaiseki) \*\*
2. l'effervescence (French) \*\*\*
3. Sushi Akira
4. Sushi Satake
5. Primo Passo (Italian) \*

For Den, I called exactly 2 months in advance 12pm JST. Spam called about 300+ calls.  
Around 10 of them got thru with tone, but only 1 picked up at around 12.25pm. (Already booked out)  
So I settled for the waitlist and the lady was very nice taking down the details.  
Emailed them on the waitlist status on how many groups in front (So they know of you, and know your email) a tip I got from other redditors. Very helpful! After 2 weeks, they called me and I got in!

For Primo Passo, l'effervescence, do refresh Omakase page at the exact time they release the slots! (Just need some fast fingers to get the tables for 2!

For Sushi Akira, I booked through Tableall and paid the 8,000 yen fee.

For Sushi Satake, fuss-free, just book through Tablecheck, the easiest of them all.

Upcoming Osaka Kyoto trip:

1. Kashiwaya Osaka Senriyama \*\*\*
2. Vel ROsier \*\*
3. Sushi Kawano
4. Yakitori Ichimatsu \*
5. Pierre \*

For Osaka, it is fairly easy when compared to Tokyo. All can be reserved via Omakase or tablecheck with ease.

The sommelier was friendly and made incredibly reasonable suggestions, the manager was warm and the various waitstaff who came to our table were engaging and at times even cracking jokes. 

We have visited many Michelin starred restaurants across numerous countries and the service did not disappoint, contrary to many of the reviews posted on this thread.

Next, the food. Wowza. The amuse bouche was a red snapper with the most perfect salty skin. I will think about the gougere often and fondly. The bread is served with a mound of salted butter nearly the size of my hand (picture with my hand for reference). The foie gras and langoustine were truly spectacular bites. I opted for the scallop and my husband elected the sole for the main course and we were not disappointed. The chocolate tart was indeed a revelation and the mille-feuilles was light but with perfect, crispy, buttery layers. Sneaker hit were the chocolate covered, cocoa dusted almonds to complete the meal.

1733763874.0,Italy 2024,"We went to 4 fine dining establishments in a grand gastronomic tour of Italy:

Enoteca La Torre (Rome) - Setting was lovely (an ornate but somewhat eerie villa) but food was mixed. The mullet and prawn salad were good. However, we found both the pastas to be unbalanced  - the lemon risotto in particular had an unenjoyable sweetness. Service was lovely and the petit fours (coming in a themed display box) was great fun. 

Le Calandre - top class. We had the classico menu with a supplement of crab paccheri and all the seafood dishes were top of the line. I never thought a softshell crab could be a fine dining dish but here it was revelatory. The cuttlefish cuppucino had deep seafood flavour, with the modern version (inspired by Venetian glass blowing) being maybe the most beautiful dish I have ever had. The ""pizza"", tagleteille with eggshells, risotto, fassone beef tartare and almond mozarella were all top-notch. And there were brilliant little ""modern"" touches too e.g. using earbuds to enhance the aural and textural sensation of a dish. 

The only dish that fell below expectations was the suckling pig, as the skin was not as crispy nor the meat as juicy as I would have liked. 

Service was unobstrusive and confident, and wine pairing was my favourite of the trip. 

Francescana at Maria Luigia - Our favourites here were the old OF stalwarts, which were conceptually tight and at times mind blowing. The 5 ages / textures of Parmegiano Reggiano was clever. The crispy part of the lasagne had my favourite ragu ever (the unctuous mouthfeel!). The riso camoflague, celebrating the mountains, land and sea of Emilia-Romagna, was executed impeccably - I actually preferred it to the hallowed Le Calandre saffron risotto! Lastly, if this is important to you, Massimo also made an appearance halfway.

Despite the amazing food, there were a few misses:

1) Cod with a Thai-inspired sauce, which incidentally was the newest dish on the menu, felt out of place. The cook was ok, but if you have eaten properly in Thailand it is difficult to be inspired. The story / concept behind the dish also was not as compelling. 

2) We were the only Asian/English speaking table of 4 (a rare occurrence) and there were service missteps. The sommelier took a while to come speak to us about drinks and it was strange to see many tables getting their wines poured before we even ordered our wines. And when we conveyed our order to the FOH the sommelier misheard it. But to their credit this was rectified later. 

3) FOH gave a long spiel in Italian to the room about the backstory behind the courses before they were served. Thereafter the staff came over to explain it to our table. This was fine, but we were definitely getting the abbrreviated version (e.g. the conflict between Massimo and the cheese consortium over the 5 stages of parmegiano reggiano dish was not explained) and had to use a garbled google translate to get more out of it and make further inquiries. Once we asked, the staff was happy to elaborate. I won't expect, say, a kaiseki restaurant to be able to furnish that much context but given the importance of storytelling to the Francescana experience and the FOH's clear capabilities, I wish they did more to provide necessary context. 

Despite the above, I still recommend CML to anyone who loves Italian food!

Il Luogo Aimo e Nadia (Milan) - our last meal of the trip and a lovely one at that. We had the Percosi menu and loved it. My favourite dish was the scampi with almond cream and nduja - absolutely glorious cooking. The ossobuco pasta, spagetti with squid and chestnut/persimmon dessert were also top tier. Unfortunately, we were once again let down by the suckling pig, as the skin was abit tough and not better than a good Cantonese or Spanish roast. 

In many ways the anti-Francescana, as this was straightforward ingredient-based cooking. The oyster dish actually resembled CML's ""Mont St Michel"", and the differences exemplified the varied philosophies. Whilst Il Luogo garnished a whole oyster with apple slices and other vegetables, CML paired an oyster foam with lamb tartare and added apple granita. We preferred the briny mouthfeel of the oyster in the former, but thought the use of granita for the latter led to a better melding of flavours. It all works as long as it tastes good!

Service was sincere and welcoming, and the wine pairing good though slightly less exciting than the Le Calandre one. Highest recommendations if you're in Milan! 

We also went to many humbler establishments and loved the following:

Cucina della mamma (Naples)- home dining recommended by a user here. Great homey food - highlights included fresh mozarella, paccheri with ragu and branzino. The sibling duo were lovely and we had an immensely enjoyable conversation with them! 

Osteria di Rubbiara (Outside Modena) - of Bourdain fame. Great Emilian food paired with some of the world's greatest balsamico. Swept the whole menu.

Alle Testiere (Venice) - Great seafood - especially the razor clams and monkfish. 

Il Bargello (Florence) - my favourite Tuscan meal. Picci with white ragu and parpadelle with cinghiale were highlights

1733762342.0,Stages in Dover NH,"I first learned of Stages, Evan Hennessey’s fine dining restaurant in the sea coast region on NH, in a comment here in this sub. Here my dumb ass has been chasing the opportunity to eat stars across the globe when there’s a tasting menu in my backyard, so we were excited to give this spot a try. 

We went as a party of 4 for this 6 seat/2 seatings a night experience. We made the reservation about a month ahead of time and didn’t have a hard time getting a reservation. The meal and drink pairings were fully paid at time of reservation. I made note of dietary restrictions (I’m a pescatarian) at time of reservation and they were able to accommodate without hesitation.

The experience starts in the “living room”, the front section of the restaurant which is truly set up like a cozy living room. Loved the vibe, would return just for drinks and small bites. A star of the show were the cocktails/mocktails, as I understand developed and served by the incomparable Marta. Her service was delightful, and her enthusiasm for her creations was infectious. As someone with folks who don’t drink in my life, I loved that the drink menu was set up that everything was a mock tail with the optional add on of alcohol, that mocktails were not an afterthought. I had a drink with pineapple, fermented daikon, and ginger that knocked my socks off, and got to sample my party members drinks which were all fantastic! Thank you Marta! The initial bites from the kitchen were also lovely, particularly a pastry bite that had perfect crisp texture and flavor.

We were served another 8-9 courses in the kitchen. Sadly I was having too much fun to take any photos, but overall we found the meal to be exciting, innovative, and thoughtful. While not every course was a knockout (we found the scallops to be underseasoned, the beets a bit blah), there were several courses that made my eyes pop out of my skull. One was a lobster foam/crispy quinoa/spicy kimchi powder that blew us away. Other winners included a wild mushroom Madeline right out of the oven served with a brie ginger honey dunking sauce, a smoked/cured tuna dish with a pomegranate reduction and hazelnuts, and a dessert I can hardly describe without sounding insane-a sorbet with some buttermilk basil sauce and another autumn olive I think oyster sauce?! Bananas good. Never had anything like it.

There seems to be a strong focus on foraged and local ingredients which we really enjoy. The wine pairing was nothing to write home about, and we would opt for the cocktails instead in the future because they were so special and clearly where the bev directors heart is. The staff is pretty pared down, Evan and who we assume is his sous served all the food, and they really didn’t have a lot of time or bandwidth for chatter (we’re nerds and love talking to staff, but not everyone needs or wants that). I got the impression that the menu is constantly changing and evolving depending on seasonal ingredients and the state of their ferments/cures/etc, so we look forward to returning in another season to see what they’re doing. 

Overall, we had a lovely time and feel grateful to have a spot like this within an hour from home. Thanks for the chance to share our experience!

Here is the country count:","|| || |Denmark |1| |France |4| |Germany |5| |Italy |3| |Norway |3| |Portugal |3| |Spain |8| |Sweden |4| |Switzerland |1| |UK |5|

Edit: not sure why the table doesn't populate for me, but here's the breakdown:

* France: 4
* Germany: 5
* Italy: 3
* Norway: 3
* Portugal: 3
* Spain: 8
* Sweden: 4
* Switzerland: 1
* UK: 5

I have visited 17 of these restaurants so far. I found the following 6 restaurants to have great-tasting sushi, listed in order of my preference. I would repeat these, although not at the price point for a couple of them.

* RONIN SHOKUNIN, Milan, Italy (2023). My experience was specifically with the head chef from Hatsune in Tokyo. He seems to travel between Milan and Tokyo. While everything was amazing, this is the most expensive at around 580€, just for the food.
* Sabi Omakase, Stavanger, Norway (2022). Most of the fish was local with the rest imported from Japan. The cost was probably around 200€.
* Zuara, Madrid, Spain (2024). This is very expensive, close to 500€ with extras.
* IYO Omakase, Milan, Italy (2023). The counter is manned by a Japanese chef and after the meal, he brought out all of the available sake and let us taste whatever. 200€.
* Aska, Regensburg, Germany (2023). Japanese chef. 250€ with extras.
* Oyster Lodge, near Frankfurt am Main, Germany (2023). Japanese chef. 230€.

While the following three were great, I would not repeat:

* Sabi Omakase Oslo, Oslo, Norway (2023). This has the same owner as the one in Stavanger. Won't repeat because I found the Stavanger location slightly better. 425€ (includes sake pairing).
* The Sakai, Frankfurt, Germany (2023). This is closer to traditional edomae sushi, although I don't remember there being a lot of sushi pieces in the tasting menu. This is the main restaurant and the chef has a branch store in Tokyo. 150€.
* Omakase, A Coruña, Spain (2023). Had a conversation with the chef about the lack of high-end sushi in Spain and he mentioned Kiro Sushi in Logroño, mentioned below. 90€.

Mid-level, the following 7 restaurants had decent tasting sushi, also listed in the order of my preference:

* Sushi Anaba, Copenhagen, Denmark (2023). 215€.
* The Araki, London, UK (2022). I visited some time after they lost their 3 stars. This was very expensive, which I didn't think was justified by the quality of the food. I liked their tuna pieces a lot, although I think some of this cost extra. 500€.
* Sushi Sho, Stockholm, Sweden (2022). This is not Sho style. 145€.
* Kiro Sushi, Logroño, Spain (2023). This has a lot of Spanish influence with unique tastes. 150€.
* Omakase Ri, Lisbon, Portugal (2024). 98€.
* Ushi, Munich, Germany (2023). Japanese chef. They didn't have a long omakase option when I visited, but I suggested it to the chef as the sushi was good. 80€.

Meh:

* Omakase Wa, Lisbon, Portugal (2024). I found this to be more of a show and ""experience"" than an emphasis on great-tasting sushi. The sushi is too westernized with too many ingredients and perhaps catered to the ""European palate."" 105€.
* Alex Sushi, Oslo, Norway (2022). This was the most disappointing experience for me. This is more like a regular sushi place trying to do an omakase meal than a high-end sushi omakase restaurant. I was at the counter and there was a couple sitting next to me. The woman somewhat loudly proclaimed how amazing this was after every bite. Perhaps it was the best-tasting sushi to her, which is fine as taste is subjective. But the disappointing sushi for my tastes in combination with her constant proclamations made it an annoying experience. Probably cost less than 135€.

I believe the below restaurants have omakase sushi, but I have not visited them yet. I likely will not visit the restaurants in Paris or London.

* Sushi B, Paris, France.
* Sushi Shunei, Paris, France.
* Jin, Paris, France.

1733754620.0,Seeing Beyond the Plate: A Little Vent on Fine Dining Perspectives,"I get why people might see a photo like this and immediately focus on the price, especially if they’re not familiar with fine dining. But it’s frustrating when they overlook the context of a multi-course meal—often 3 to 21 courses—where each dish is part of a larger experience.

Not everyone is privileged to experience fine dining, and honestly, some of the prices out there are insane. Even as someone who appreciates the craft, I find it staggering at times. But as a home chef (not a pro, just someone who loves cooking), I can really respect the time and effort that goes into creating dishes like this. The sourcing of ingredients, the prep, the cooking, and the plating—it’s an art. Most of the time, we’re being served the best of the best, not mass-produced or processed food.

If you’re lucky, these meals take you on a journey. It’s an opportunity to be truly present and engage 4 (or even 5) of your senses, especially when there’s a story behind the dish. When done well, how many other life experiences can do that?

Anyway, it’s not that deep, but I just wanted to share this little vent. I’m grateful for this sub because I feel like most people here get it—that fine dining is so much more than a single plate with some herbs and a flavoured leaf.",finedining

1733713908.0,Recent Visit to Atomix** (& Acru),"Over the past 2-3 years, I’ve dove deeper into fine dining and fallen more in love with food than I ever thought possible for myself. I’ve had the pleasure of having so many dishes that made me burst into a smile and indulging in too many delicious meals to count. Of these meals, I would consider just a few them truly remarkable, and Atomix fits very comfortably in this category. I’ve seen a range of complaints in this community over the past few years ranging from the dishes not being traditional Korean enough to the service being too cold to the food simply not living up to the countless accolades and difficulty of snagging a seat. Regardless, I continued to pursue making a visit, failed several times, and then finally got the chance last week. I found the service to be perceptive and engaging, the ambience to be striking and inviting, and the flavors to be so damn good. The textures, the plating, the saucework - exceptional on all levels.

The meal started off with two amuse bouche - a fermented quail egg on top of uni wrapped in gim bugak (super clean tasting, crispy fried seaweed) and then this tart with filefish, veal (tartare-like), Kristal caviar and a mini dollop of a creamy sauce with chive in the middle. Both were larger-than-one-bite size which was a pleasant surprise compared to most amuse bouche courses I’ve had and they really delivered right from the get-go. Clearly well-thought out bites with some nice balance of crisp in the vessels (seaweed and the tart) that counter-balanced the softness of the protein components of the bites, further elevated by subtle seasonings and less prominent yet still crucial touches of ingredients. 

First course consisted of a few beautiful pieces of yellowtail layered on top of each other sitting in a brown nuruk sauce, sesame sauce with fig, and a small salad. The pieces of yellowtail were delicately cut yet hearty and went very well with the nuttiness and light sweetness of the sauces. Nothing ridiculous here but a simple and enjoyable start that made me hungrier for more. Next course came in a stunning green sauce - a burnt bitter green oil made from broccoli rabe and spinach. I thought burnt bitter green oil didn’t sound very enticing and actually did find it to be my least favorite component in any dish throughout the night. The rest of the dish was a bright pink golden eye snapper, littleneck clam, egg jjim, salted shrimp, abalone, ginger, soju, and countless other ingredients. The abalone shined and texture combinations were fun but overall, the dish left me longing for a kick of more citrus and maybe some sweetness to counter the bitterness of the green oil. This was followed by a dish made up of a crisply sliced bright green Korean zucchini that comes with king crab (omitted from mine due to allergy), tofu, doenjang, bean sprouts, and a white lotus tea dashi with grapefruit, honey, ginger, fish sauce, and sesame oil. For all the ingredients going on with this dish, felt really light and fresh, and again, the textures were just astonishing. Last of the appetizer section, a largely cold section of the tasting, was this radiant orange flying fish roe gelatin with chives, typically served atop soy marinated blue crab but replaced with an incredibly soft white fish for me that I can’t recall the name of. This was served with a golden queen rice with a Korean seaweed and mumallaengi (marinated dried radish). The menu seemed to begin to shift here and start to reach a new level.  The flavors developed with each bite, growing in complexity, and each bite of the dish was somehow different than the last and better than the last. The colors of the ingredients were striking and the softness of the fish mixed with the rice somehow went really well with the gelatin blanket of flying fish roe covering it. 

I had a good feeling going into the main courses, and Atomix truly hit a different stratosphere with these next courses. The first main course was whiting - a mildly sweet white fish also known as hake - that was fried in the most beautiful crispy better I’ve ever had the honor of tasting. The batter evoked having the perfect funnel cake for the first time when you were a kid. But the sweetness was restrained. The crisp was ethereal. Then they throw in a soybean paste cured egg yolk and eggplant and a semi dried fermented plum because why not. And the sauce with the fermented plum juice gel with white balsamic, fish sauce, and agar agar. This sauce in this dish stood right there with the best sauces I tasted at Epicure in Paris (didn’t think the saucework would ever get better than there). As ridiculous as it may sound, there was an audible gasp from one couple and more than a few patrons burst out an “Oh my God” upon their first bites. The dish is a hit. It’s sweet, buttery, nostalgic, and texturally perfect. Served with a side of these cold green spaghetti like noodles with the most delicious small almost shiny red tomatoes. Perfect fresh and cold contrast from the savoriness of the fish dish. Love seeing attention to detail and complementary flavors like this even in small side dishes. Then came the sea bass with Jimmy Nardello peppers in this dark brown Cheongju sauce. The seabass was cooked perfectly, soft and buttery and lightly crisped in a way that stood up perfectly to the boldness of the Cheongju sauce. The peppers, fried broccoli rabe leaf, and dried scallops in fermented black bean, shallots, and oyster sauce just elevated and added excitement and fresh tastes to each bite. This came with a beetroot kimchi and cuttlefish on the side that again perfectly added a freshness element to the course. Last main course was a generous pile of large strips of precisely medium-rare A5 Miyazaki wagyu in a garlic sauce with chicken stock, veal sauce, and fermented mushrooms. The other components included cranberry beans, elderberry, korean pear, fermented soybean soy sauce, and egg yolk jidan. Was it the best steak and eggs I’ve ever had? Yes. I’m typically not one for throwing a wagyu dish at the end of a tasting menu, as I often find it a lazy way to justify the price, and the dishes are often repetitive, but this felt like the right timing and was just so tasty and a captured deep beautiful flavor. The sauce felt like an elevated teriyaki sauce that happened to be paired with the best meat you can have and soft strips of egg yolk jidan that is mixed with a ton of other tiny components that make for a perfect end to the savory dishes.

Dessert was exactly what I was looking for - not overly filling or overly sweet so as to overbear the flavors of the prior courses, and I always love desserts that evoke my favorite sweet moments from childhood. The Korean pear granita with ginger ice cream and grape and vanilla sauce was a light acidic transition between the main savory courses and the final chocolate and fermented autumn chestnut dessert. This final dessert was a stunning plate with two glossy, perfect spheres - one a Doraji chocolate cake with Doraji ganache, cocoa crumble, a soybean mousse, and a cocoa glaze and the other a black chestnut ice cream. They balanced off each other so well and the chocolate cake one for some reason reminded me of the first time I had tartufo. It was the dark chocolate exterior and glaze with the excitement of discovering a filling that just took me back and was just intense and rich enough to get me to the perfect full. 

All in all, whether Atomix gets upgraded to three stars or not tomorrow, I’d encourage anyone with a love for food and fascination in exploring new flavors and textures to give this a try. My experience was littered with small, beautiful moments but one last part of the night I thought was a nice touch. The sommelier overheard me  during the main courses talking about a California trip I’m planning to take early next year and how cool it’d be to hit some restaurants I’ve been meaning to try. Before I left, he slipped me a postcard that included all his favorite restaurants in different parts of California and excitedly gave me a rundown of each of them and his experiences there. Obviously didn’t take much from him, but this is all to say, they know how to make you feel special at Atomix. I think it’s the best restaurant in New York, and it truly feels like a restaurant operating at the top of their game.

***

As a side note, I also visited Acru the night before Atomix, the new restaurant from Daniel Garwood who was sous chef at Atomix previously. At $95, great value for a new tasting menu in NYC that really surprised me in how good it was this early on since they opened recently. Scalloped potato with uni was a fantastic start and meal was a great progression, with each course almost improving over the last. I will say my favorite course was this playful dish they prefaced by asking if you had fruit rollups as a kid. They proceeded to bring out a smoked trout filled acorn squash “fruit rollup” in a maple acorn squash broth with caramelized cream, szechuan peppercorn, and sumac. The fruit rollup aspect was the most elevated take you could have on a texture that was so nostalgic, and every element of the dish complemented it so well. Another hit was the oyster mushroom with chicken skin and golden tile fish that was in the most velvet-y green laksa sauce. Excited for what’s to come from this restaurant as I really loved it all from the engaging staff to the laid back and rustic atmosphere to punchy flavors and elite textures.",finedining
1733709372.0,Eleven Madison Park - Dec 2024,"Here is my review of Eleven Madison Park. It’s quite long. I am not including any pictures, but if you are curious about any of the dishes, I recommend you check out James Andrews review on YouTube. I had the exact same menu, and from what I can tell, even sat in the same seat with the same server. 

I have been following Eleven Madison Park for close to 14 years. I love cooking and professional cookbooks. I first heard of them when I saw their book at a Barnes and Nobel. I fell in love with the food immediately and bought the book. I loved that the story of reinvention and the inspiration and influence Miles Davis had on them. 

Then they closed and relaunched around 2012. I remember seeing the first reviews and again, I was blown away. The black and white cookie that was actually savory. The cheesecake with caviar. Carrot tartare. Cabbage layered with foie gras. And of course, the duck. 

For whatever reason I never thought about trying to dine at EMP. I did a lot of traveling for work, and I do think I got to experience a very close version of the dishes a couple of times. The first was in Chicago and Boka. The head chef, Lee Wolen, had worked at EMP, and had a very similar duck dish on their tasting menu. It was incredible. The second time was at the Nomad restaurant in Las Vegas. Daniel Humm was still involved with them at the time. I got to have a simplified version of the carrot tartare and again, the duck. 

So once they went vegan and I saw the reviews, I was resigned to never going. But then, they announced the latest cookbook, the plant based chapter. After receiving the book, and watching one YouTubers review, I decided to go. I booked the full tasting for lunch on the Saturday I was going to be in the city. Here is my review. 

It is of course a beautiful dining room, although much smaller than I expected. Service was of course, top notch. I ordered a couple of cocktails which I asked to be brought out whenever they felt was appropriate for the meal. The first dish was rice inside an onion petal with Thai basil. There was also an allium tea served. The rice dish was, fine. Something I will be repeating a lot in this review. The allium tea however, was amazing. Incredibly savory and comforting. The same way a perfect chicken soup broth is. And that is probably the most impressive thing there. Almost all of the broths and sauces were very deeply flavored. 

Next up was a cold leek salad. Beautiful presentation. The leeks were served cold and not my favorite. But the sauce they were in was quite nice. 

They then brought the bread and butter. I was very excited to try this as obviously there was no traditional butter used. The bread was amazing. I commented on the flakiness to my server and he mentioned Dominique Ansel actually collaborated with them to develop the recipe. The squash butter in the other hand, was fine. Having released the cookbook I can see the process they go through to create this butter and it is quite labor intensive. However, it would be so much better if they were simply vegetarian and could make cultured butter. As a side note, I want to say the most interesting butter I have seen is at Sean Brock’s Audrey. It is served as a room temp ball shaped scoop, but inside there is a seasonal jam. I have had it with both a squash jam and parsnip jam and both were incredible. This is what I expect from EPM, but I was a bit let down with. 

Along with the bread and butter cake the avocado with tonburi. I was not that excited about this course, but it turned out to be quite nice. The tonburi was nice, but certainly not caviar. There was some cucumber under it all. 

Next was a silken tofu with collard greens. While I did enjoy the dish, it felt out of place with the rest of the meal. The silken tofu had amazing texture, and I feel like this could have been so much better. The greens were fine. The broth was the best part of the dish. 

Next was a rutabaga skewer. The standard menu is a lightly breaded mushroom. However, I really dislike mushrooms, so the restaurant kindly replaced the mushrooms with rutabaga. 

The dish itself was, again, fine. It was nice and crispy, but I grew tired of it. The sauce was not memorable at all. 

They then wheeled out a large custom clay grill / steamer. Added a lemongrass broth, and opened it up to reveal some bok choy. They shaved some white truffles over it and served with another broth. Again, the broth was very good here. But the bok choy was just, steamed bok choy. It was presented beautifully, but again, steamed bok choy. A side note on the white truffles. This was my first time with them and I thought they were a bit underwhelming. I am not a huge truffle person to begin with, but I thought they were supposed to be more aromatic than black truffles. 

Finally, the last savory course came. The one that pushed me over the edge to make the reservation. Red Kuri squash. The week before  I had spent about 10 hours cooking in an attempt to make this dish from the cookbook. It was one of the better courses. The broth was incredible. The finger lime and chili oil were nice. But the squash was just, fine. 

And with that the savory courses were completed. I was presented with what I would call an ice cream sandwich wrapped in mochi and some grapes. As far as I could tell, nothing had been done to the grapes. Just, grapes. 

Then I received the last bite. A chocolate covered pretzel. 

I was a bit disappointed because I thought they took people back to the kitchen before the dessert course. I was presented with my bill and told that they had one more thing planned for me if I had time. After a few minutes, someone came from the kitchen and gave me the tour. They had made “apple snow” and dipped maple syrup in it until frozen. It was a nice treat and I felt special. 

And that was it. I did receive a jar of their granola which was nice. But no printed menu. In the end, I do not regret going at all. I am thankful that I am in a position to travel and have these experiences. But my overall impression is that it’s just, fine. And for $400 after tax but before drinks or tip, I don’t think fine cuts it. Maybe if they were vegetarian instead of vegan they could do a bit more. I have no idea what it cost to run a restaurant. Especially one that has such a huge kitchen staff. But I feel like the food was worth about $200, considering the experience. I expected more desserts. More small bites to start or in between. 

Even if I forget all the incredible dishes from the past, I feel like straight up vegetables could be better. Maybe smoked or roasted. Vegetables cooked in their own juices. I feel like I have experienced so many better vegetable sides at other restaurants.

I guess I just can’t shake the feeling that they are cutting corners. I think this is evident since Will Guidara has left the group. I will give an example of the recently released cookbook. It is a very nice set. The main cookbook, which is about as large as the previous two. Then another “behind the scenes” picture book. Finally there is a binder with a couple of art prints which, frankly, feel self indulgent. But the previous book they released came with two books. One for the recipes, and another equal sized book with hand drawn sketches and stories for every dish. 

If you made it this far, thanks for reading. As I said above, despite all of the criticism, I am still glad I went. But I will not return. At least until the next reinvention when if they go back to their roots. ",finedining
1733699909.0,Gymkhana: hype or real?,"Hey everyone,

I'm spending a few days in London soon. We booked Gymkhana and a few other joints I'm more confident in. Based on mixed comments on this sub and in other places, I suspect Gymkhana may be more hype than substance.

I'm wondering if I should cancel the res and book elsewhere. We definitely want to book at least one Indian spot. I'm less concerned about the money than wasting it on a place that is overhyped and stuffy; I'd rather have a relaxed experience and spend less if the food is going to be as good/better at another Indian spot.

1733698454.0,El Chato #25 world & #3 LatAm,"Ate at El Chato by Álvaro Clavijo while in Bogota last month and had an excellent meal. He mentioned he would be in DC on Dec 12 for a collaboration dinner at Xiquet* by Danny Lledó in Washington DC.  I’ll write a review of that collaboration dinner later this week. 

1.	Welcome Cocktail
This was a great way to kick things off—refreshing, tropical, and herbal. The mix of guava and cedrón was bright and unique, a perfect introduction.

2.	Melon
Such a simple dish, but wow, the flavors were amazing. The melon was super sweet, and the garum and trout roe added this salty, umami kick that worked perfectly.

3.	Crab
I loved this one! The crab was tender and sweet, and the hoja santa brought this subtle, herby flavor. The tendon added a fun chewy texture—it all came together beautifully.

4.	Squid
This was super creative. The squid was cooked perfectly, and the kohlrabi added a fresh crunch. The tree tomato gave it just the right amount of tanginess to balance everything.

5.	Beef Heart
Honestly, I wasn’t sure what to expect, but it turned out to be one of my favorite dishes. The heart was tender and rich, and the ube and sacha inchi pipián added this creamy, nutty flavor that was amazing.

6.	Trout
Such a delicate and elegant dish. The trout was light and flavorful, and the nasturtium flowers gave it this peppery bite. The cubio added a nice earthy touch—I’d never had it before, but I’m a fan now.

7.	Snail Tamale
This was comforting and packed with flavor. The snail was tender, and the pusandao broth was so rich and satisfying. Definitely a highlight.

8.	Oyster
I loved the freshness of this dish. The guatila added a nice crunch, and the lemon balm brought a bright, citrusy flavor that made the oyster shine.

9.	Tomato & Beet Dish
This was vibrant and full of surprises. The koji gave the tomatoes this deep, savory flavor, and the sweetness of the beet and strawberry balanced it out beautifully. It was light but full of flavor.

10.	Grilled Chicken
The chicken was perfectly cooked and had that great smoky flavor from the grill. The zucchini and broad beans were simple but fresh, making this a comforting and familiar dish.

11.	Soursop Dessert
So refreshing! The soursop was tangy and bright, and the viche added a bit of a funky, fermented edge that was super interesting. It really woke up my palate.

12.	Fennel Dessert
This one was surprising. The fennel paired with kumis made for a creamy, tangy dessert that was totally unexpected but worked so well.

13.	Eggplant Dessert
I’ve never had eggplant as a dessert before, but this was mind-blowing. The smoky vanilla and earthy beans made it sweet, savory, and just unforgettable.

14.	Petit Fours
These little bites were the perfect way to end the meal—sweet, delicate, and satisfying without being too much.",finedining

1733679229.0,Jan*** Munich,"This is the only 3 Michelin starred restaurant in Munich!⭐️⭐️⭐️🇩🇪 

Today, we are at @janhartwig_official in Munich, 1 of only 10 ***Michelin starred restaurants in all of Germany. 

Join me on a 15-course marathon with four hours of culinary intensity at 3 Michelin starred Jan in Munich. Every bite challenges your expectations, surprises your palate, and demands attention. By the end, you’ll know you’ve had something special.

The highlights? Where do I start? The char with fennel and combava vinaigrette is a masterpiece—fresh, vibrant, and perfectly balanced. The duck with foie gras and anchovy sauce? Indulgent perfection. But the real magic comes with the quail egg in serrano ham broth, corn, and parmesan—a bite that’ll make you rethink everything you thought you knew about food. 

Jan’s sauces are a clear strenth: the umami beurre blanc, anchovy sauce are so complex and balanced.

The flavors here lean heavily into a mix of classic French techniques and Asian influences - rich French cooking meets the complexity of Asian ingredients. It’s bold. 

Not everything hits the mark, though. The eel soup and cheese dish didn’t quite measure up to the rest of the meal. And the bread? Fine, but for three Michelin stars, it’s nothing special. You’ll find better at a quality bakery in Copenhagen. 

The desserts, while enjoyable, could have benefited from being a bit fresher, especially after such rich and heavy dishes. A refreshing granité or something lighter would have helped balance out the richness of the main courses.

Still, Jan’s talent shines through.His Laboratory of Love lives up to its name—precise, meticulous, and impressive. Is it truly three-star worthy? Maybe not in my book, but it’s definitely an experience.

We ordered the pig out for two main course which consisted of berkshire pork, spicy peanut noodle, and two sauces.  The peanut noodles were very rich and filling.  The pork squares had tender meat similar to suckling pig and a crunchy skin top.  They recommended mixing the two sauces and adding to the pork.  We ordered the broccoli with fermented shallot, garlic, sichuan chili as a side item, which was excellent.  The broccoli was cooked well but the sauce is what made the dish.

1733643325.0,Kouan (Fujisawa) (November 2024),"This Japan trip, I make an effort to visit a few places that were awarded Michelin stars in one-off guides/guides that are no longer updated. One of them is Kouan in Fujisawa. Three stars were bestowed upon this restaurant when the Michelin Guide for Shonan was still published. 

My feast there starts with sake from Iwate and an appetiser combining the sweetness of oysters with that of figs, with chrysanthemum petals and greens providing another autumn accent. A soup of improbable depths ensues, featuring stretchy shirako tofu perfumed with maitake. 

The sashimi course revolves around buri, tako (octopus) and kombu-marinated hirame (flounder), to be dipped in soy sauce or mustard sauce. Nagaimo and sesame seeds are sprinkled on top of the buri, lending new textures. 

The highlight of the meal is a seasonal platter that includes the crunchy beads of tobiko and tonburi, an incredibly wobbly and rich ankimo, a tangy saba sushi, sweet potato boldly flavoured with cream cheese, a rosy slice of duck and slippery nameko covered with a thick blanket of tofu sauce. 

The rice that precedes desserts is cooked with daikon, soft and sharp, and oyster dashi, in a throwback to the first course. The meal ends with a restorative pear, pumpkin and pomegranate dessert, as well as a warm and comforting kudzuyaki crowned with bean paste, the sweetness of which is tempered with matcha. 

One thing that stands out is the precision of textures woven into the courses - be it soft, slimy, stretchy, slippery, crispy or crunchy, every texture is spot-on. A spirit of generosity is infused into the meal, with a pack of rice included as the take-home gift. 

At slightly more than 8000 yen, it offers value for money. The food may not be the most divine I have come across, but it delivers pleasure in spades. If I find myself wandering in Fujisawa again, this is a place I want to revisit.",finedining

1733620994.0,Per Se*** NYC,"I had been to The French Laundry and was not that impressed so was curious about Per Se.  I enjoyed Per Se much better.  The service seemed on another level.  Also, at TFL, I dined with another couple and when we asked about a wine pairing, they said, “how much can you afford?” I felt this was terrible service as this caused an uncomfortable conversation as the income levels between my dining partners was huge.  At Per Se they offered set pricing levels but also said they are flexible.  This was handled much better.

1. Parsnip “Velouté”
The velvety soup was a perfect opener for a chilly evening. The sweetness of the parsnip was beautifully balanced by the tart cranberries and the crunch of hazelnut streusel. The petite parsley added just enough herbal brightness to keep things interesting without overwhelming the dish.

2. Citrus-Cured Japanese Shima-Aji
This dish showcased the beauty of restraint. The Shima-Aji was fresh and buttery, enhanced by a bright citrus cure. The puffed quinoa granola added texture, while the avocado mosaic offered a creamy, indulgent counterpoint.

3. Hokkaido Sea Urchin
Sea urchin can often be polarizing, but here it was sublime. The briny uni paired perfectly with the sweet, delicate peekytoe crab omelette. The trout roe brought a smoky depth, and the garden chervil added a whisper of freshness.

4. Stonington Sea Scallop “Crudo”
The scallops were flawless—silky, sweet, and fresh. The Kishu mandarins added a delicate citrus pop, and the Espelette vierge brought a subtle heat that lingered just enough. The green radishes were a surprising and welcome textural element that made the dish feel alive.

5. “Oysters and Pearls”
This dish is famous for a reason, and it continues to deliver. The tapioca sabayon was luscious, with a buttery richness that enveloped the perfectly briny oysters and the luxurious caviar. It’s indulgent without being heavy, and it remains a dish that defines Per Se’s legacy.

6. Hen Egg Custard
This was pure decadence. The custard was impossibly smooth, with the earthy black truffles adding an intoxicating aroma and depth.

7. Pomegranate “Sorbet”
The sorbet was a perfect palate cleanser—vividly tart, but balanced by the nuttiness of Sicilian pistachios and the tangy complexity of aged balsamic. It was refreshing and invigorating.

8. Salad of Norwich Meadows Farm Salsify
This was a standout for me. The salsify and chestnuts provided a warm, earthy base, while the Castel Franco radicchio and ruby red lettuces offered bitterness and crispness. The white truffle vinaigrette tied it all together, creating a salad that felt indulgent yet grounded.

9. Hudson Valley Moulard Duck Foie Gras
The foie gras was rich and buttery, as expected, but the accompaniments elevated it to something unforgettable. The sweetness of Honeycrisp apples and earthy beets was offset by the tangy crème fraîche, creating a perfect harmony of flavors. It was decadent, but never cloying.

10. “Bread and Butter”
Sometimes, simplicity is the ultimate luxury. The laminated brioche was golden, flaky, and buttery, paired with a deeply flavorful farm-fresh butter. It’s a testament to how much care goes into every element of the meal.

11. Norwegian Langoustine “à la Plancha”
The langoustine was grilled to perfection, its natural sweetness amplified by a subtle smokiness. The scallion escabèche brought brightness, and the bonito aioli added a savory depth that tied it all together. A deceptively simple dish executed flawlessly.

12. Four Story Hill Farm “Rillettes de Poularde Cordon Bleu”
This dish was a hug in food form. The chicken rillette was deeply satisfying, with the silky pommes purée acting as the perfect partner. The black trumpet mushrooms added an earthy complexity, while the Bordelaise sauce brought richness and balance.

13. “Carnaroli Risotto Biologico”
Risotto is often a measure of a chef’s skill, and this one was perfection. Creamy, luxurious, and infused with Castelrosso mousseline, it was elevated even further by the Alba truffles. The aroma alone was intoxicating, and every bite delivered pure comfort.

14. “Suprême” of Stardust Farm Squab
The squab was tender, flavorful, and beautifully cooked. The crispy papadum added an unexpected crunch, while the creamed crimson lentils provided a velvety, earthy base. The carrots were sweet and vibrant, bringing a touch of lightness to the dish.

15. Charcoal-Grilled Miyazaki Wagyu
This was the pinnacle of indulgence. The Wagyu was so tender it practically melted, with a smoky char that added depth. The creamy veal risotto and black truffle-Madeira jus made this dish feel like the ultimate celebration of luxury.

16. Aged “Comté”
This was a perfectly timed transition course. The Comté was nutty and complex, paired with a delicate feuille de brick tartelette. The black truffles added an earthy richness that lingered beautifully on the palate.

17. Caramelized Gala Apple
This dessert was a delightful play on contrasts—sweet, tart, crisp, and creamy. The caramelized apple was perfectly balanced by the cultured cream, while the pie dough tuile brought a nostalgic crunch.

18. “Tres Leches”
A creative take on a classic dessert. The cake was moist and flavorful, with the golden pineapple and rum caramel adding a tropical warmth that felt surprising but welcome.

19. “German Chocolate Cake”
This dessert was pure comfort. The dark chocolate mousse was luscious, while the biscuit Joconde and coconut meltaway brought texture and nostalgia. It felt indulgent without being heavy.

20. Mignardises
A charming end to the meal, the mignardises were small bites of perfection, each more delightful than the last. They felt like a sweet farewell and a gentle reminder of the thoughtfulness behind every moment of the evening.

1733566258.0,The Embassy - Siem Reap Cambodia,"November 29th, 2024
My wife and I had the pleasure of dining at The Embassy in Siem Reap, Cambodia.  After a day of temple explorations, we cleaned up and got on over to this wonderful resturant.
There is a beautiful open courtyard with dining seating available for those who want to be outdoors/can handle the heat.
Upon resturant entry you are greeted by a host and asked to sit in their comfortable entry seating area.  You are offered a drink menu to start and the 'street bites' course is soon to follow.  

After your small bites, you are taken into the kitchen for your 2nd course.  It is served at a counter, as the kitchen operates next to you.  
At this point you are brought to your table.  

The inside dining rooms are refined and artfully adorned. AC units are on the walls but here cleverly de-emphasized by design and art features.  It was warm when we came in and the staff readily turned on our closest unit to cool us off for the rest of the meal.

We both did the set menu and it was a delight.  Khmer cuisine is unknown in our home area and we were pleased by the flavors, champagne pairing, as well as the great staff that served and guided our meal.

I included the menu for those interested in the dish descriptions!

The staff were all female and this is intentionally by the chef, who is empowering locals through her resturants.  We also ate at her Phnom Phen resturant Sombok, with similar opinions on food quality.

Our parting gift from the meal was homemade macarons to go.  They were fresh even the next day when we ate them!

My wife and I both found the soup course to be the 'best' for us.  It was delicious and as my wife said ""I could eat that all day.""

If you are in Siem Reap for Angkor Wat or the other temples, this is a great place to have a fine meal!

1733561524.0,Places with heat in London (or around the world) with heat? (I went to Akoko recently and was surprised/delighted with the level of spice/heat.),"I love fine dining like everyone here, but the Michelin star places have never had spice or heat, until I went to Akoko. I was taken aback and delighted by the amount of proper spice there. It's West African and there was a lot of Scotch bonnet in quite a few dishes, not like a one off, but actually in three dishes.

I was wondering if anyone could recommend any more tasting menus with real heat?

The three best fine dining Indian resturants (proper heat!) places I've been in London are, Kutir in Chelsea, Tamrind Kitchen in Soho, and Darjeeling Express in that upstairs bit of Carnaby Street.

These three don't have Michelin stars and are not tasting menus, they're just spectacular authentic high quality Indian food.

I'm also not looking for any particular location, these happen to be West African and Indian.

(Also someone will mention Dishoom, yes it's good, but it's more fashinalbe like sketch, you will get good food in there but you can also get better without the fashion. Haha.)

1733541433.0,"Kuruma Sushi (2*, Tabelog Silver)","Kurumasushi is well known among sushi aficionados for the quickest and youngest sushi chef ever to earn 2 michelin stars. Chef Takahira trained at Sushi Yoshitake (2*, previously 3*) and returned to Matsuyama in 2017 to take over his father’s sushi-ya. Within a year of running the restaurant and at 27 years old, he was awarded 2* in the 2018 Special Michelin Guide for Hiroshima & Ehime. The restaurant currently has a Tabelog score of 4.40.

The seafood predominantly comes from Seto Island Sea and is believed to be ‘stress-free’ due to its calm waters. Most of the fish were line-caught in the morning and spiked ikejime to maintain the aroma and flavour. Rice seasoning was punchy due to the blend of 6 types of red and rice vinegars. Wasabi was on the strong side.

8 seats counter, with one half attended by the chef’s father and another half by Alvin, a sous-chef from Sweden for ease of communication reasons. There were 3 foreigners that night and I was seated just off centre. Alvin’s life story was pretty interesting: moved to Japan for love, had omakase at the restaurant and was offered a job. 

Menu below, with favourites being ise ebi, sawara, isaki, watarigani and nodoguro. The chef is also a certified sommelier and has a good selection of wine and local sake.

1733499278.0,Alinea - Gallery Experience - November 2024,"Grant’s Chef’s table episode kicked off our interest in fine dining. I’m in Chicago often for work but I haven’t been able to line a trip up to take my wife in some time. I think I’d be looking for a divorce attorney if I went without her and I was finally able to make it happen.  We were somewhat last minute and the only open space was in the Salon but we asked to be put on the gallery waitlist and got the email that morning. 

The ambiance of the restaurant is that of a theatre. There are sounds, trickery and quite a few other theatrics. If I hadn’t been fortunate enough to have quite a few unique dining experiences the last 5 or so years then my brain would have melted. I couldn’t imagine if this was my first fine dining experience, part of me wishes it was and part of me is happy it wasn’t. 

Service was excellent. Not a tonne of small talk because they are so adherent to the schedule. Food comes in rapid fire. You get a lot of it. No chance we would be able to finish all of the dessert. Everyone was pleasant but I sometimes do enjoy hearing people’s careers in fine dining and how they got there. We got that out of a few, but closer to the end of the night as their work was almost done. 

Wine was very good. We opted for by the glass. Somm was pleasant and really knew his stuff. A couple beside us was ordering a bottle and his knowledge of different vintages of a California wine was crazy. 

Food was great. There was a lot of it and a lot of different flavours. A lot of food tended to be on the saltier end of the spectrum. I wouldn’t say over seasoned at all, I was just shocked by how much they didn’t shy away from salty on salty flavours.  

We’re so glad we went. I’m extra glad we were in the gallery.  If it’s on your list, just splurge. You cannot have a bad time here unless you’re a dickhead haha. Yes I read the article. One really cool thing they did was that there was a regular who loves Busch light. They bring it in for him when they know he’s coming. That is absolute class. Dude was still drinking the wine pairing but they really wanted to be accommodating and go above and beyond.

1733472876.0,Barcelona - unpopular opinion: would not recommend Lasarte at all,"Disappointing for 3 reasons:

#1: 4 out of 8 of the main dishes that we had were not balanced in someway. 

Also, the pre-appetiser snacks were mostly misses. Whatever that was done well, was done very well, but I can’t fathom having half the menu either being too salty / having too little of a key component that it got drowned out / just not going together.

Based on photos of other reviews that I’ve seen, I think the menu was tweaked slightly at the point of our visit. Not sure if it was complaints about the portion sizes being too much, but they definitely reduced the portion of things like the carabineros which led to way too much broth / sauce and the flavour of the carabineros getting drowned out

While my partner and I are not part of the 0.01%, we both have had exposure to fine dining since we were teens, and continue to do so through work and personal interest. We may not have the most sophisticated palate, but I doubt we are that very much far behind that we’ve missed the point of that many dishes totally.

#2: Just trying to charge… and charge?

Additionally, on top of the higher pricing (12-20% more than the other 3 stars), they want you to pay another EUR48 for a small addition of white truffle AND it did not enhance the dish that it was recommended for (it was better off on its own…). 

This is still not the most expensive meal that I’ve had, but versus what we got, it was disappointing.

#3: Finally, and this is a pet peeve of mine, but I hate it when fine-dining restaurants charge like 2.3x retail price for wine. 

You’re already charging a lot for the food, just cut it out and make something reasonable on the wine. 

I cut back significantly on drinking 5 years ago and don’t drink much now, so maybe I’m out of touch, but even Disfrutar doesn’t seem to do that (at least based on the wines that we’re interested in and checked out).

Anyways…

We tried Lluerna the previous day and it was fantastic, just solid delivery of food. Technical execution was definitely slightly better at Lasarte, but it’s not worth that much if the flavours and overall vibe are off for a 3 star.

Trying Disfrutar later today and CH tomorrow, am really hoping that Barcelona’s remaining 3 stars do not disappoint",finedining

1733440212.0,Fire—Chicago,"New restaurant from the alinea group. The concept is open hearth, fire as the centerpiece. I recently tried smoked room in Madrid, and I love smoky flavors so I was looking forward to this. Fire just opened so they probably have some kinks to work out, however with the alinea group behind them I expected better. I will say the juniper shrimp tail with honey was lovely, great texture, as was the ice cream with scorched dairy. I actually got some of the scorched flavor from it, unlike most dishes. The chawanmushi that came with the halibut was also nice, silky and delicate. 
My dining partner was enjoying his maitake when I mentioned that mine was too watery. This surprised him so we traded, only to find that we were served two very different dishes. His was slightly crisped and tender, quite tasty. Mine was really bland and soggy.

In most tasting menus I’ve experienced the beef had been the standout, here it was oversalted and probably one of my least favorite dishes. We also ordered a few cocktails, nothing special except the “khaos reigns” which ended with such a strong floral, perfume taste that it felt like being trapped in a Sephora. 

I liked the concept with the sweet potato dish, I think the tartness of the grapes overpowered the Comte though, and overall just felt a bit disparate. 

Set menu + four cocktails ran us ~$350. We didn’t get the menu to take home or any little treats. I thought they also had a wine pairing but didn’t see it on the menu, only when we were booking. Bathrooms are in the basement, utilitarian, no hand lotion, but they are single stalls at least. They only do a set menu. It feels like they’re in this weird space between more casual and fine dining. Curious to see if they make any changes as they get more settled.

3. Disfrutar --> Most innovative experience ever. While the food wasn't the best I have had, the techniques and ways of plating were very interesting to experience one time.

I am looking for recommendations. I would be glad to have your perspective / advice.

I would like go to a nice restaurant in Berlin. 

Maybe sharing this below could give an idea of my tastes?
I have already been to Bon Vivant. I did not find it perfect but it was really good.
I have been really extremely underwhelmed by Cookies Cream. It was far from a good experience.

In Lyon, I have been to Culina Hortus several times and it was always awesome. Really great best I have had so far despite not having a star (the chef told me they are in the race / strive to have one).
I am not searching for something vegetarian necessarily. 

I am currently looking at options in Berlin and so far I think that Horvath could be nice (maybe first pick), then potentially Facil (notably for the magnificent desserts) and then Coda. 

I thought of Rutz but it really does not seem exciting when I look at the menu (maybe to close to ""traditional"" German? I do not know....I am not feeling it base on the menu).

Besides the restaurants mentioned above I think of these below as well:
Hugo
Bandöl 
Bricole
Faelt (this seemed really interesting)
Frea

What would be your recommendation based on this?

1733260646.0,Sugita - Tokyo ,"I’ve lived my entire life in Japan and have been fortunate to experience some of the best sushi spots like Sushi Namba, Sushi Arai, and Sushi Inomata. But for years, getting a reservation at Sushi Sugita has felt like an impossible dream.

I’ve tried everything, including the app *Omakase*. However, every time a cancellation appears, it’s gone in a split second. I’ve clicked the notification immediately, but it’s always taken—likely by bots or scalpers. It’s so frustrating.

If bots are scooping up reservations, what chance does an ordinary sushi lover like me even have? I feel like I’ve exhausted all my options.

Are there any regulars of Sugita here on Reddit who can offer advice? Is there a secret to getting in? Or should I just resign myself to the fact that Sugita is one of those places where luck and connections outweigh persistence?

I’m open to trying anything—whether it’s tips, tricks, or even hearing about how you’ve managed to secure a seat. I’m so passionate about sushi, and Sugita has become my white whale.

Any help would mean the world! 🙏

Thank you,

Quintonil: best food, service and ambiance. 
-We were surprised how small the dining room was, only 10 tables and maybe 8 seat at the chefs counter. This made it feel intimate. The meal was well paced. Every dish had excellent presentation and was full of flavor. Some dishes were followed by a “show and tell” which was interesting at times and not too intrusive. The meal felt special and was a great experience. 

Rosetta: we were able to walk in and get an outdoor table early on Saturday night with no wait. We had two appetizers, sea bass and red snapper. Everything was fantastic. Service was casual, but attentive, however inside may be a bit more formal. Would absolutely go back again many times. 

Pujol: least favorite! Something about the crowded indoors and movement/number of servers felt slightly chaotic. The food was just ok. I can’t stop thinking about one course that was broth with some cherry tomatoes. It was so uninventive and tasteless I couldn’t understand why they served it to us.

1733125110.0,Nakashima (Hiroshima) (November 2024) ,"Sometimes it can be difficult to distinguish between a one-starred Japanese restaurant and another with two or three stars. After all, their course structure is largely similar - an appetiser that pays homage to the season, sashimi, soup and a series of dishes based on different cooking techniques, from grilling to steaming, followed by rice and the dessert course. The quality of ingredients is likely to be stellar regardless of how many stars the eatery has. What, then, is the criterion for differentiation? 

I seem to have found the answer at Nakashima, which was awarded three stars when the Michelin Guide for Hiroshima was released years ago. It is astonishing how a tiny eatery can evoke so much beauty and luxury. It starts with the bowls and plates, which are often steeped in history and aesthetic significance. The blue bowl that contains steamed fish and kabu turnip is 200 years old; another bowl is said to date back 100 years. A bowl and its cover often have matching patterns, usually flowers that flow from one side or part to another. The staff are well-versed in the story behind each piece of tableware or artwork - for example, I am told that the chrysanthemum plate on which sweet, supple strands of squid from Shimane coated with dried mullet roe are placed is made by an artist in Ishikawa. Sake is served in a glass that evokes sunrise on Mount Fuji. The postcards that guests are given at the end of the meal are hand-painted by the chef's father in a touching display of family support. 

The effort translates into the food too. Sashimi, for example, is a three-act play, starting with smoked sawara, followed by a blend of file-fish flesh, liver and skin and the aforementioned squid. The dashi used abounds in depths, its inherent sweetness of a level hard to find even in Japan. Against that beautiful backdrop, meaty mushrooms and crab are in a tango, their flavours amplifying each other. The shirako in the assertively seasoned chawanmushi course is among the creamiest I have come across while wild boar from the mountains of Hiroshima stars in the grilled course, together with a plethora of vibrant vegetables. 

The supporting cast for every course is stellar - for instance, the wasabi that complements the wild boar is grown in Hiroshima and of a size rarely seen. Enchanting scents, be them yuzu zest or smoke from the grill, pervade the kitchen, heightening anticipation before a dish is served. Even the miso soup is a triumph and not an afterthought. 

Nakashima is arguably one of the most memorable dining experiences I have had in Japan. It is a mesmerising meal, a revelation and an education.",finedining

1733116649.0,"Kyoto reviews: Velrosier lunch, Koke dinner and Kiyama lunch mo","Velrosier (**): 4/5 Japanese food with Chinese influence 
- Loved that many dishes paid homage to Chinese dishes like sweet and sour pork(2nd photo), Peking Duck wraps (3rd, but this actually had saba and radish cake), Shanghainese crab (5th photo), dimsum, deconstructed gyoza (first green pic) 
- Everything was very well cooked and perfectly seasoned 
- Plating and format of the dishes were also really fun. Lots of little spheres, served on things that don’t look like bowls/plates 
- Dining room is fairly small. At times the head chef himself came out to serve and explain the dish which was very cool. 

Koke (*): 3/5 Okinawa ingredients/food, Spanish influences 
- There were too many things going on in a single dish sometimes. The last photo I shared was a winter melon that you put a salad (with dressing) and homemade ricotta with its own seasoning all over the wintermelon. There were too many flavors fighting in your mouth. 
- Some dishes were creative like the various tapas and the root beer chocolate bomb 
- Some of the servers under-explained the dishes and I don’t think we fully appreciated them…and when we asked why something was used or where the idea came from, she had no idea. I would expect much higher level of knowledge for front of house staff at a started restaurant. 
- Overall I felt like the chef was trying to do wayyyyy too much in one dish and needs to refine his ideas a bit more. Many of the dishes felt like rough drafts to me tbh :/ 

Kiyama (*): 4.9/5 Traditional kaiseki centered around dashi/katsuoboahi as key ingredient 
- Dashi was indeed amazing. It was cool to see it get filtered with the freshly saved bonito flakes too 
- All the dishes had amazing flavors that brought out the flavors of the ingredients. Well seasoned, no unnecessary elements and highly seasonal menu. 
- it’s nice they let you adjust the portion sizing of the rice and noodle dishes at the end. One of the sous chefs explained one dish more and suggested we get a bite sized portion bc foreigners don’t typically like it, which was helpful. The clam broth ramen was soooo good, as was the cod milt over rice — which says a lot because I don’t really like cod milt!
- I’m knocking it by 0.1 because the tempura course was very disappointing. Very hard batter and wasn’t even hot. Felt like it had been sitting for a while and got cold…that was surprising. 
- I wouldn’t be surprised if they got another star soon! ",finedining
1733116564.0,"Suggestion) When visiting South Korea, try a Korean-Chinese course menu.","This isn't a review or any kind of a critique, but more of introducing a (not really) hidden scene of South Korea's fine dining. Honestly, Korea itself does not have a strong fine-dining scene, nor Koreans are aware of it as much as... let's say people in r/finedining. However, every Korean will know Korean-Chinese (arguably Shandong/Tawainese/Qing dynasty) course menu, and I would strongly say this is the strongest fine-dining scene in Korea. Nothing like American-chinese or even Chinese food, Korean-chinese food is what Chinese immigrants created to appeal to Koreans from the late 19th century.

Using budget as a scale, I can divide these restaurants into three tiers: Cheap, Casual, Expensive

Cheap: This is where people in every economical status will eat if they dig a cheap Kor-Chinese food suddenly. Personally, I would say it's sort of in a dying breed/transitional stage, especially for their own unique delivery system in the past: for example, the delivery man would come to your home and do a final touch, just like how waiters sometimes pour the sauce after the dish is delivered in a restaurant. But as delivery apps and franchises are becoming the standard, with more kinds of affordable delivery foods competing with this, this kinds of independent restaurant/delivery food are becoming harder to find.

Now, you might be asking, ""Why is this guy talking about delivery food?"" Well, some of these restaurants do serve prix-fixe menus, or you can create prix-fixe course. It is rare, but I have seen some cases, hence writing this option. Honestly, I wouldn't recommend this unless you have a close Korean friend who's a kor-chi food aficionado.

Most well-known places: nearby some of expensive but old apartment sites in Seoul, Incheon Chinatown, or hidden gems in Korea.

Casual: This is where I would mostly recommend, as these places are relatively cheaper, and mostly trendy.

Most well-known places: Apgujung (Korean Beverly hills I guess) district of Seoul (most famously Mutan), and some restaurants in Incheon/Busan such as Hwagook banjum(화국반점). 

3) Expensive

Most famous restaurants are Mokran, The Great Hong Yuan, and Palsun, these kinds of restaurants will most likely to have a course menu like fine dining, and I would recommend these as a safe bet. I have only been to Palsun a numerous years ago, but I can say I had a familiar experience as fine-dining even before I learned about fine dining. I am not sure about the current Palsun's quality since I heard the previous chef left, but that's about any other famous restaurants. 



Tip: As you raise the budget, I would suggest Jjam-Bbong instead of Jjajangmyeon as an entree, as Jjam-Bbong's taste depends on the seafood's quality, instead of Jjajangmyeon that mostly depends on the Chun Jang sauce. Jjam-Bbong is usually spicy, but you can ask for less spice, or even ask for white Jjam-Bbong (백짬뽕).",finedining

1733072922.0,Guy Savoy Las Vegas,"Went to Guy Savoy in Las Vegas last night.  The meal, service, and wine pairing were excellent.  

1.	Seasonal Amuse: A small, tasty bite to start. While there’s no wine with this, it sets the tone for what’s coming.

2.	Colors of Caviar: The dish was all about the caviar, and the Grüner Veltliner paired with it was fresh and crisp. It had a nice balance that worked well with the salty, rich flavors.

3.	Binchotan Charred Octopus, Caviar, Citrus: This was paired with a 2007 Piper-Heidsieck champagne, which was bubbly, creamy, and just the right match. The citrus flavors in the dish and the champagne’s elegance really brought it together.

4.	Daurade, Mushroom Gratin, Marinière: The fish was delicate and paired perfectly with the Meursault wine. The wine was smooth and buttery, which complemented the creamy mushroom gratin without overpowering it.

5.	Artichoke and Black Truffle Soup: This was a standout dish—super rich and earthy with the truffle flavor. The aged red wine (Volnay 1988) was soft and smooth, with just a hint of fruitiness that balanced the boldness of the soup.

6.	“Sealand” A5 Japanese Wagyu Beef and Lobster: Talk about indulgent! The Wagyu was melt-in-your-mouth good, and the lobster added a nice sweetness. The Bordeaux wine paired with it (from 1996) was deep and rich, with a little spice that worked so well with the bold flavors of the dish.

7.	Tête de Moine and Confiture: The cheese was creamy and mild, and the sweet jam on the side added a nice touch. While no wine was specifically paired, the earlier ones could’ve worked well here too.

8.	Chocolate and Orange Textures: The dessert was delicious—rich chocolate with a hint of orange. The Kracher dessert wine was sweet and fruity, almost honey-like, and matched the dish perfectly without being overwhelming.

9.	Louis XIII Pouring: Ending the meal with a small pour of Louis XIII cognac felt so luxurious. It’s smooth and complex, the kind of drink you sip slowly to take it all in.",finedining

1733064173.0,"Septime, Paris. (One Star)","Hello.  Recently there was a thread about Septime that made me very nervous. 
With apologies to the OP, I’ve both forgotten your name, and don’t want this to seem like a response per se; just offering my own insight from the night, which was very enjoyable. 

Booking Septime was hard work. Bookings go live two weeks in advance, 10am Paris time. On our day, bookings for two seemingly shat the bed and never loaded. We managed to snag a Three and then emailed to see if two was available, and unbelievably, but still of believably because I refused to believe that tables for two really went to fast, they obliged. 

We started our Septime Evening with a trip
to their bar La Cave around the corner. Service there is polite but direct and to the point. They let you try the wine before pouring a full glass because it’s all natural, and I have previously heard staff go to great lengths to try and find “something like New Zealand” for two ladies that were way out of their depth. No need for us; we drank a glass of Beaujolais and whatever orange they had on BTG. 

Going around the corner to the restaurant, the welcome was warm and hospitable. We were sat on a large table that we ended up sharing with another couple at the far end, near the door and bar, but this was not an issue for us. We were further away from them than we may have been another table in the main dining room. 
For being so close to the door, comings and goings were few and infrequent, or we weren’t affected by them.  I work in the restaurant industry so being near or on a bar is still enjoyable. 

The menu or lack thereof was politely explained and we were offered aperitifs which we declined because we had been next door. I perused the wine list for a white to work with the dishes that I didn’t yet know. 

Regarding photos, please excuse them. It was dark, even with a nice expensive hanging light over our table, and colour temperature was a nightmare too. I’ve tried my best. 

I’m going to give quite truncated explanations for the dishes because my memory is awful and I didn’t exactly take notes. 

 First bite or sip was essentially a veg broth or soup. This was very comforting and homely, with a distinct but not stuffy hum of cabbage. 

The next was a position of grisini style bread sticks with Comte sauce dusted in nutmeg. This was delicious, and despite my reservations the sauce to stick ratio was fine. The nutmeg gave the dish a savoury eggnog feel. 

I chose a bottle of natural-sounding white Burgundy, listed as a Bourgogne Blanc, but appearing to be a VDF. I imagine previous vintages may have been Burgundy; and this is declassified. Either which way I imagine the juice is near enough, and it had a distinct orchard fruit note, and savoury texture that I was looking for. Price was fine €50-€60, so with us coming from Britain, a bargain in fact. 

First course, raw scallop with squash and cape gooseberry was utterly delicious. Elegant, bright, clean. Becca’s favourite dish. 

Next was a triumph of flavour. Mushrooms with a mushroom veloute and pine foam. Despite this general softness of texture, the interplay of earthy forest floor and green heady pine was intense and incredible. 

Celeriac and seaweed was a low point for Becca, who found the whole experience akin to face-planting a slipway into the sea. As a child I was less accident prone than her; but I understood her dislike. I however enjoyed the dish and the flavour combination and felt the dish delivered on exactly what it promised. 

The roasted cauliflower with caper and caper leaf… maybe… was my least favourite because I simply remember the least about it. I felt that the cauliflower itself could have been cooked out slightly less, served more generously or charred more. Nothing else really wrong with it, but a bit of a stall in the runnings of things. 

All throughout this dishes were well-paced and service incredibly polite, convivial and seemingly genuine. 
At one pint I overheard the youngest member of the Team being slightly scolded for not topping up our wine [enough] and us being explained to that he used to be a KP and wasn’t essentially brand new to FOH. I made a point of insisting that no harm was done. The entire team seemed to be of multiple nationalities, and as such were speaking in English. I imagine that sometimes nuance in language and tone can be lost when you’re both speaking your second or third language during a busy Friday night service. 

The impact of the dishes picked up for the main course. Loire valley - probably Anjou pigeon; served with an excellent sauce, anchovies… and a fruity pureé that I can’t remember…. On the side was a flat bread of dark meat, and/or offal with some pickled tiny peppers on top. 
This was excellent.  Beautifully cooked pigeon as you’d hope for. The sauce was great. 
I ordered and received from our young recruit a glass of Morgon Corcelette from the same Beaujolais producer I had at La Cave, and the pairing was perfect. (Well done me). 

Sweet courses started no so sweet with a bowl of most-probably-Lacto-fermented berries in their juices. This was pretty delicious and not overly sweet. It had an almost wine like dryness to it. 

Finally, the chocolate was simultaneously delicious and somewhat disappointing. Perfectly good chocolate ice cream, with a slightly spicy chilli oil. 
I hate “chocolate crumb” as it screams that the kitchen doesn’t have a Pastry Chef… but I feel this kitchen doesn’t have a pastry chef, and this still really needed some texture. 
And looking at it, and thinking about it, I just really wanted it to be a chocolate mousse, to be perfectly honest. 

We finished with a lovely soft sponge cake that may or may not have had an almond or vanilla flavour. Not because I couldn’t detect, but because I don’t remember. 


Overall, despite what may be perceived as some criticisms, we did enjoy our experience at Septime. The highs were very high, and the troughs were mainly a personal taste issue, although I can’t say I look back fondly on the cauliflower, and I wish they had a Chef who could just bash our chocolate mousse all day, or make a really banging tarte au Chocolat with an expensive, special chocolate. 
I found the price of €135, with reasonably priced interesting wine to be fair too, but I’m used to London prices, that would have invariably been more for the food and 50-100% more on the wine. 

Happy to answer any questions as best I can. Sorry that my dish descriptions are short. ",finedining
1733058222.0,"Cdmx:  Quintonil, Em and Maximo ","I’ve seen a lot of posts lately on cdmx fine dining and was excited to try it. 
But I’m leaving extremely disappointed with the exception of Maximo which was amazing.  Quintonil started great but I didn’t enjoy the entomology course at all and that has to with taste.  Not the bugs.  Most of the 4 dessert courses were lackluster as well. 
Em was completely forgettable.   It was extremely loud and noise from the street as well as people smoking outside and occasionally ruined the meal.  Wine service was poor. They took the bottle away for 15 minutes to open it and then had to ask for the cork back.  We did the fast in menu here and it seems that the use of cancer was abundant but this didn’t enhance any of the selections. 
Lastly at Maximo we had an octopus ceviche which blew me away. We also shared an iberico ham with tomato confit which matched well. My wife order baby corn in hollandaise and we shared a lamb birria and flavors were perfect.   We shared one main, the Wagyu tongue in mole sauce which I could eat forever. 
This was the least expensive, though not inexpensive but far and away the best meal.  ",finedining
1733047971.0,Restaurant Gordon Ramsay London,"Well I fully confess to having been a massive Ramsay fan having seen his dedication and skill that went into leaving L’aubergine and forming his own restaurant in such a lovely part of London. Appreciate he isn’t to everyone’s taste but he is a British icon and no one can deny his success.

As such my wife and I went for a splurge meal at RGR. We have eaten in a few starred restaurants before but wouldn’t proclaim to be experts. It is just a part of life we like to indulge in sometimes. Our favourite 3 star previously was La Pergola in Rome (meeting Heinz Beck was also a highlight!). This meal was also our first away from our young baby daughter as we left her at home with her Aunt.

The one word I would use is ‘polished’. The welcome was formal, polite yet retained warmth. I was glad we were sat in the main dining room (not chef’s table) as it was exclusive yet still convivial. Conversation was flowing and instantly one felt relaxed and excited for the experience ahead. Aperitif of Tanqueray and tonic went down well, before canapés served. Autumn salad singing with blackberries and a smokiness of guanciale started things off nicely. Ingredients did the talking without pretentiousness. Next the signature lobster ravioli with a sauce Americaine really was as good as expected. The lobster retained texture and the ravioli so thin as to not take over the dish. I believe there was fresh tarragon running through the filling too which was lovely. Again a very classic sauce made well to go with the ravioli. The turbot dish was exceptional and had a touch of Nori powder externally. Smoked pumpkin and the single clementine segment provided a much needed citrus burst. My wife is pescatarian therefore had a spelt risotto course which she found overly seasoned but tasty. I went for the pigeon. The pigeon cookery was great and the liver and Alsace bacon ragu was the perfect accompaniment. A sharp apple and calvados pre dessert did the job before the pecan praline dessert. I thought these were ok but as desserts go I’ve had much better.

Overall the experience was lovely. Being the festive season the dining room had a tasteful seasonal decor also. The service was pleasant, not overly personal but that was fine with us actually. You were allowed to chat and dine without a myriad of interruptions. Sommelier was nice enough, suggested an excellent dessert wine as it isn’t my usual choice. Wine wise we went for a 2019 Saint-Romain from Domaine Hubert Lignier. Well rounded yet floral. 

I had a wonderful evening and I think this is a restaurant one goes to appreciate the techniques of fine cooking rather than all the other bells and whistles. That may put people off but as people who work in a technical and scientific profession, we appreciate the attention to detail and techniques involved in such cookery. However one could argue it may be a little understated a restaurant for some tastes. ",finedining

1733037569.0,Single Thread Farms (***),"SingleThread Farm Review: A Near-Perfect 9/10

SingleThread delivers an extraordinary dining experience with a blend of Japanese and California-inspired cuisine, though it leans more heavily into Japanese influences than necessary. Here’s how it stacked up:

The Hits:
	•	The California-centric courses truly shone. Highlights included a salad featuring chicken liver pâté, which stole the show with its perfect balance of flavors.
	•	The dessert, particularly with the creative use of sunchoke, was a standout.
	•	The duck was expertly prepared—rich and flavorful, though my girlfriend felt it leaned a bit too much into aging.

The Misses:
	•	Some of the Japanese-inspired dishes, like the sashimi, felt overdone, losing some of their elegant simplicity.
	•	The chestnut main course was underwhelming, lacking the depth of the other offerings.
	•	In the opening kaiseki-style course, the egg custard was overcooked, though the rest of the bites in this flight were delightful.

Presentation & Service:
Visually, SingleThread sets the standard—the presentation is arguably the best I’ve seen. However, the service felt rushed at times, which slightly detracted from the overall experience. For my girlfriend’s birthday, they provided a card but misspelled her name, and there was no candle or celebratory gesture. While this might be due to the high volume of celebrations, it left something to be desired in terms of personalization.

Wine Program:
We opted for à la carte wine selections instead of the tasting menu and were impressed with their diverse and thoughtful offerings.

Final Thoughts:
SingleThread is an exceptional restaurant, and while a few missteps kept it from being flawless, it remains a must-visit for its ambitious menu and impeccable presentation.",finedining
1733028914.0,"Rezdôra, Crown Shy, Oxomoco, NYC November 2024","Rezdôra * (Images 1-5) (The menu is aggressively Italian, so as opposed to naming the dishes verbatim, I'm going to paraphrase.)
(1/5) (Center) complimentary bite from the chef. I don't remember the name, but it tasted like if you ate a bagel bite cold with no cheese. It was very bright. (Top left) Parmesan Regiano tasting menu. Pieces of parmesan aged from 12 to 60 months with the oldest drizzled in aged balsamic. It was accompanied by rosemary crackers and something that resembled horseradish. Some of the cheeses were nice, some were too strong for me. The rosemary crackers were light and airy, but they didn't include enough for 2 imo. (Top) Grilled bread, very salty. (Right) Salad with parmesan, balsamic, salt, pepper, and another sauce that I can't put my finger on. It was easily one of the best dishes of the night. I wish I had more. (2/5) Pasta with sausage. I have never tasted something so intensely meaty in my life. It was almost overpowering. (3/5) Pasta with lobster in a meat sauce topped with breadcrumbs. The pasta was perfect. You could taste lobster in every bite. It was luxurious. (4/5) Breaded pork chop with prosciutto served with arugula. It was delicious, but incredibly salty and pretty simple for a Michelin starred restaurant. I am no chef, but am pretty sure I have made a better cutlet before. (5/5) Sirloin steak. It was above average, but not a showstopper. 

Crown Shy * - (Images 6 - 14)
(6/14) Cardinal Point. Tasted like a whisky sour, not too strong and really refreshing. 
(7/14) Gruyere Fritters. Great bar food. It was basically a savory fried cheesy cake. (8/14) Braised short rib. Extremely rich meaty flavor. It doesn't taste like steak. It has its own unique flavor. The waiter took this away before I was done, which was unfortunate. I didn't try the couscous, but the sauce was really good, like a spicy mustard. It also came with yogurt, which I did not touch. (9/14) Grilled citris marinated chicken, perfectly tender. The citris flavor is really strong, and the hot sauce is the right heat. (10/14) Tuna toast - it was really spicy for a Michelin starred restaurant. The tuna was really fresh, and the chorizo and pineapple were super tasty. (11/14) Basically a sharable salad. Each leaf is individually seasoned and dressed with green goddess dressing. I am inspired to make this at home as a snack. (12/14) This is their famous pull-apart pistachio bread topped with parmesan and served with citris butter. Best bread I ever had. Sweet, salty, buttery, savory. 10/10. (13/14) La Pistola. Tasted like alcohol flower water. Terrible. (14/14) Sticky Toffee Pudding. It's served with an apple sorbet. It's incredibly sweet and indulgent. The bitterness of the sorbet helps cut the sweetness a bit. 

Oxomoxo * - (Images 15 - 18)
(15/18) Lamb barbacoa tacos. The lamb was really tender. It seems to have been braised for a while. I honestly don't remember what the flowers tasted like. (16/18) Salsa tasting. The ones I remember were a tomatillo salsa, a sesame salsa, a red chili salsa, and a habanero salsa. I can take heat, but the habenero salsa had me on my ass for a good 25 minutes. It was intense. (17/18) Fried red rice served with roasted chicken (not pictured). It has sort of an earthy taste, but very much resembles any fried rice. (18/18) (Not on menu) It was described to me as a custard. It tasted like a really rich strawberry yogurt. It was garnished with a meringue which turns out to be the best dessert topping ever. Sweet, crunchy, melts in your mouth. The fruit and granola (I think) brought everything together. It was my favorite dessert of my trip. I also went to Per Se, but there are so many dishes, that it needs its own post. ",finedining

1733021807.0,Corima NYC - Insane value @ $110,"Had a wonderful meal doing Corina’s 110$ tasting in the lower east side. I lived in NY 2009-2021 and now in LA I miss these under 150$ tastings. This was an insane value for the amount of dishes, the flavor, and the service. We DID add one 12$ truffle/sunchoke chocoflan. Cocktails were also very nice.

Highlights for me were the bean course with sourdough tortilla, the tripe/woodear taco with kimchi’d green tomato, and a huge array of desserts including a banger of a Concord grape sandwich. Would go back to try the a la carte. 

One note - I usually avoid winter tasting menus because of overload of richer/heavier dishes like squash and other roots. Corima subverted this with a lot of brightness and impact from the heat with the array of chilis they used.

1733004116.0,Nomicos (*),"Where do I even begin. While this meal was acceptable for a Michelin starred restaurant, I have received better service at a gas station McDonald’s. I have a strong feeling due to the fact that we were indeed American and this was a very residential area of Paris. Throughout the dinner the difference in treatment with other tables was pronounced. Not once did they remove crumbs from the table, offer us any drinks, or give us the slightest bit of attention aside from bringing our clearing our plate (which they obviously did for each table around us). To be fair I am a fine dining noob (probably been to around 5-10 Michelin star restaurants in my life) but all of those experiences ranged from very good to incredible while this one was awful.

When making the reservation I indicated that my partner was allergic to gluten, and confirmed it over phone. I wanted to do the tasting menu, but when I arrived, they plopped down an amouse bouche without a single word. This seemed to be a theme among every course, where there was no explanation despite each member of the wait staff we had interacted with speaking English (FWIW, my partner did speak fluent French with the staff too).

Because they could not accommodate the allergy on the tasting menu, we just ordered a la carte (which was fine, not upset here). I also asked for a wine menu, and needed to ask for it 3 times. It was eventually given to me after the appetizer arrived. I ordered the “famous” foie gras Mac n cheese with truffles which was just fine, nothing remarkable. My partner ordered the scallops which were THROWN DOWN, and you can see from the image that the sauce spilled down on the plate. The wine menu came but I don’t think that at this point I could drink enough to salvage the meal.

I went into the main with some hope, but that was quickly crushed on my first bite. I ordered the filet with foie gras. Asked for it medium knowing that I’d probably get it medium rare, but it came out blue. I ate half and when the waitress asked if something was wrong and told her about the temperature, she asked if she could put it back to cook for longer. I cut my losses and told her to just take it away.

Someone who looked like the manager came out to bring us the bill where the steak was still there, despite her giving a fake apology for the steak. What was interesting was that her mood instantly changed when she asked where we were coming from and my partner said she lived in London. After this she was super apologetic about the meal, even mentioning it again while getting us our coats.

Long story short, if you’re French you’ll probably have a good meal. If you’ve got the slightest bit of an American accent stay clear.",finedining

1732949887.0,"Ore, Bangkok(what a restaurant🤯)","I have been holding to that review for some weeks now, cause I really wanted to digest what went on that night. We were in Bangkok on our honeymoon in this tiny 6 seat restaurant, all other guests were American, which was quite surprising in a country like Thailand. The food was mindblowing, I attached some pictures of our favorite courses here. We went up in the first dining room, where all 26!!! savory courses were served, the ambience was very nice, earthy tones and the music was also pretty fun(think of African inspired slow hip hop) the food was definitely some of the most creative we have ever tried and it’s definitely up to par with the best and most creative restaurant we have ever been, which is Smyth in Chicago. All dished were unique and we tried a lot of ingredients that we have never tried before, like Egg fruit, cod sperm, snake fruit and many more. Their main course could easily be the best rice I ever had in my life there were many things inside and also some crickets, but I can really remember all the other ingredients. After the main course we changed dining room and this is the moment, where also the whole mood changed. We were moved into a completely black room with very low light(see last pictures for ambiance), and trap music was playing in the background, in the start we were shocked but as we got used to it, we really got carried away by the experience and all the amazing and super weird 6! desserts they served, one of them had natto and durian, which sounds a bit disgusting but it was definitely one of the best and most balanced savory desserts I ever had. It was definitely the best meal on our trip. After Sorn we said that Sorn is a restaurant that we could it every day because it’s very perfect and comforting, but after Ore we were just completely blown away in a sense, that me and my husband were talking about all the simple details and things that were going on for the rest of our trip. It’s definitely not a restaurant for ever day, but definitely one for those who want to experience something unique. ",finedining
1732919681.0,"Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester (***) - London, England","Courses listed at the end, along with (for funsies) my ranking of London's three star restaurants. This is definitive, of course, and I shall brook no argument...

Anyway, the review:

Park Lane is home to - among other fine establishments - The Dorchester, one of London's grand dames. Currently, the hotel is bedecked with christmas trees and festive ornaments, and it's hard to keep the legs moving, past the porters and through the long corridor where guests lounge and partake in afternoon tea, stopping before the grand piano and turning left to arrive at your destination: Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester, one of six of London's three-star restaurants (there are currently nine in the UK, two in Bray and the other in Cumbria).

After Joël Robuchon (who has held 31 stars), Alain Ducasse has the second-most all-time awarded, with 21. Currently, Ducasse has two restaurants with 3 stars, this one in London, and Le Louis XV in Monaco (where I am booked in for in March next year, so very much looking forward to compare and contrasting!) The restaurant at The Dorchester is helmed by Jean-Philippe Blondet, a chef who has been in London for the past 11 years and has worked for Alain Ducasse even longer, at both restaurants. Himself a Nice-native, Jean-Philippe is well-versed in classical French cuisine, but here is given some scope to modernize, introducing harsher citrus elements to create broader flavour profiles.

Before getting into the food, service at Alain Ducasse is exemplary. Water is placed on the table, but is kept intentionally out of reach; the message is clear that you are not to lift a finger other than moving fork to mouth. Wait staff are extremely attentive and chatty, and - a rarity for London, but not for other kitchens elsewhere mind you - welcome guests to enter the kitchen and chat with Jean-Philippe (we spoke about socca, a Nicoise speciality) at the end of their meal.

As for the food, I found quality to vary, not so much in the quality of cooking (everything was masterfully prepared), but in the conception of the dishes. The scallop dish, the venison dish and the quince and chestnut dessert all really worked for me. The scallop dish had a citrus bite that I imagine to some may have been too much, as I felt that it was right on the edge of becoming overbearing; however, I think it landed, and the dish is one of the finest scallop dishes that I've had. The venison I really enjoyed because of the space the meat was given. It could have been so easy to over-sauce it, but the clean taste of the meat really came through, with the cabbage and jus ample supporting characters. As for the chestnut and quince: what a marriage, and fitting given the season. Despite my juvenilely phallic arrangement of the bread, I was smitten with the Scottish bread and soy curd, and ate far too much of this that by the end there was not a chance in heck of doing up my suit jacket.

Other than these three dishes, the rest were decent but unremarkable, with two in particular standing out for opposite reasons than those mentioned above: the lobster was - quite frankly - boring. I'm not sure what was trying to be achieved here, but it seemed like a bit of a waste of a premium ingredient. And then there was the sorbet pre-dessert, which was overwhelmingly sour. That the next course featured another sorbet (this one being actually rather good), I struggle to see the point in including this first sorbet on the menu.

Despite the dishes that didn't make me sit back and luxuriate in the flavours that they had to offer, I still enjoyed my time at Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester, and would recommend it over a couple of other London three-stars.

Courses:

1. Canapés of betroot; seed crisp and raddichios
2. Bread: Rye and Scottish, with butter and soy curd
3. Cep and wild mushroom broth, blackcurrant, oxalis and cocoa nib
4. Hand-dived orkney scallop, citrus (lemon) beurre blanc and Kristal caviar
5. Artichoke palette cleanser
6. Native lobster, artichoke and shiso
7. Dover sole, Tom's watercress, hazelnut and agria (pictured first)
8. Saddle of venison from Rhug Estate studded with lardo delle Apuane, Kalibos cabbage, and charred apple condiment
9. Assortment of French cheeses (comte, brie, blue)
10. Yuzu sorbet pre-dessert
11. Quince, crispy chestnut leaves, lightly smoked jus
12. Petit-fours (apple tarte tatin, chocolate and whiskey)

Finally, my London 3-star ranking:

1. CORE by Clare Smyth
2. Hélène Darroze at The Connaught
3. The Ledbury
4. Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester
5. Restaurant Gordon Ramsay
6. Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library

1732823593.0,"Kuromori (Miyagi, Tabelog Bronze)","Kuromori is a Chinese omakase restaurant in Miyagi Prefecture with a fervent focus on local ingredients. 

For a large-ish city like Sendai that has excellent produce originating from the sea on one side and mountains of the other side; I was surprised to see there are only two >4.0 tabelog score restaurants. Both are Cantonese-food, with Kuromori being the highest rated restaurant, while the second ranked restaurant is helmed by his ex-sous chef. 

The meal style at Kuromori is kaiseki-esque and the omakase during my visit encompassed:

1. Yakuzen (herbal soup)):  warm medicinal soup made from ginseng, dried scallop, chicken,  mushrooms, & cured ham.

2. Hassun (seasonal appetiser): a showcase of Chinese cooking techniques (steam, braise, grill, fried etc) as well as different flavour profiles in Chinese cooking  (sweet, spicy, savoury, sour). 

- Spring roll filled with green eye fish
- Sea eel with sweet soy
- Wild rice with preserved cabbage
- Lotus root with XO sauce 
- Pickled Okura flower
- Stirfried spicy beans
- Taro rice cake

3. Agemono & Yakimono (fried & grilled dish):  Crispy skin fried chicken using local aoba jidori and charsu (BBQ pork) using Saito branded pork.

4. Miyagi (vegetables): Salad with locally grown seasonal leaves and sprouts. Not a lot of dressing but was sufficient to cleanse the palate. 

5. Takiawase (simmered dish): blue shark fin stewed in a stock made with homemade cured ham and served with Chinese cabbage and yellow leek. Kesennuma in Miyagi is the largest shark fishing port in Japan and has a long-standing tradition of using the entire shark meat without waste.

6. Donabe Gohan (rice dish): sasanishiki rice cooked in claypot loaded with generous amounts of matsutake mushrooms. The sweetness of the rice contrasted nicely with the earthiness of the matsutake

7. Mushimono (steamed dish): flaky belt fish blanketed with a translucent roll made from winter melon. Very hearty and refined at the same time. The broth looked  lightweight  but had good flavour from fish bones essence.

8. Itamemono (stir fried dish ): Sendai beef is one of the premier beef in Japan and here, Kuromori-san simply wok-fried the beef with local bullhorn peppers and oyster sauce. Very clean tasting with some wok hei (breath of the wok).

9. Kouumen : uumen is type of somen specific to Shiroishi city made simply with salt water and flour. Served with warm consommé-like chicken and soy broth. 

10. Mizumomo (dessert): a tofu-less doufuhua, with jersey milk used in lieu. Kabosu citrus was added for freshness and zing. The meal finished with warm osmanthus tea.

Kuromori is located in a suburban modern building doubling as a house (upstairs) and restaurant (downstairs) with a good view of the town. The chef’s wife speaks good English and also acts as sommelier. Chopsticks came in a box and can be taken home as souvenirs.

Dinner price was 20,000yen per person before tax and came with a membership card so that the chef can cook different dishes for the next visit.  Lunch is priced at below 10k yen and focuses on dim sums. Reservation is via table check. I would recommend Kuromori for a refined Chinese omakase if you are visiting the Tohoku region. ",finedining

It always felt like every year or so some critic was going to come in and say how it isn’t worth the money to go and dine at TFL and Per Se. Neither of these restaurants are to reinvent the wheel in fine dining. That’s not the intention. If you listen to any interview with TK, he wants to showcase the best purveyors and ingredients in the best ways, in the style they’ve always done it .  They do what they do and they do it well.  Maybe it is dated to people like restaurant critics and other fine dining people who can afford to do this all the time.  Almost all of the diners that came in, though we’re always overjoyed by the end of the meal and for a lot of them the meal was a pilgrimage and likely the only time they were going to with us or do any three star.   We worked really hard for it to be fun and an unforgettable experience for everybody.  I feel like reviews like this aren’t new or shocking either.  They add nothing that hasn’t already been said by a new critic on the block.  All reviews like this do is close people off to coming into the world of fine dining. Fine dining isnt every day dining.  it’s expensive and unrealistic for most people to do regularly.

Additionally, I'm wondering if you could share some of El Celler de Can Roca's “signature dishes” (if there’s any). I'm particularly interested in their innovative cooking style and whether any of those signature dishes are available at Esperit Roca.

1732754913.0,"Albi (*) Washington, DC (Thanksgiving take-out)","Came out to about $300 for what is advertised as a meal for two. We had three people and still a sigmificant amount of leftovers.

Albi is a very popular local DC restaurant by Palestinian chef Michael Rafidi. The cuisine is modern Levantine. It's his flagship restaurant that received its Michelin star a few years ago. It's usually booked for reservations a month or two in advance and is popular, with generous portion sizes and a reasonably priced menu.

This is Albi's take on Thanksgiving classics with an Arab flavor profile.

1. Seven Spiced Amish Turkey Breast

The turkey was a tiny bit dry but that was remedied by the gravy. Very flavorful with a clean taste. The seven-spiced/za'atar on the skin wasn't very pronounced. 

The idea of date molasses with turkey was absolutely brilliant. Not only did it add more moisture, the tanginess and warm sweetness of the date coupled perfectly with the flavor of turkey. It's definitely the replacement to cranberry sauce (although we had that as well).

2. BBQ's Turkey Leg Pave

Although not the best presented dish, this dark meat was absolutely amazing. It's barbequed shredded and crushed turkey leg. Incredibly smoky, juicy, with a rich flavor.

3. Mujadarra

The mujadarra served at Albi proper is definitely superior to what was given here. Additionally, the portion size was so small for this. While it makes sense for some of the other dishes to be tasting size, this one was too sparse.

3. Hearth Grilled Brussels Sprouts with lemon and kibbeh spice

These were pretty good. I'm more of a fan of drier crispier brussel sprouts or spinach leaves than grilled like this, which still retained some softness and moisture.

4. Smoked Root Vegetable Stuffing

This was mind-blowing. The stuffing must have been taken for a final pan frying before being served. It was crispy, light, and delicious. The best stuffing I've had by far.

5. Sweet Yams with halva butter

Incredibly light and airy with a delicious sesame halva sauce on top. Sweet and fluffy.

6. Potato Puree

Whatever they put in these potatoes made them unbelievable. The urfa pepper added a much needed spice and umami to what I ordinarily find a boring dish. However the puree itself was head and shoulders above any mashed potatoes I've had before.

7. Cranberry jam with orange blossom 

Zesty and strong but not overpowering. Fresh and strong cranberry taste, but with a reserved amount of sugar.

8. Honey ras al hanout pecan pie with labne chantilly cream

It's wonderful to have a dessert with the exact amount of sweetness. Not overpowering, but just enough to bring out the flavors of what youre eating. Labne chantilly cream had a very light labne taste which went very well with the pecan pie. The honey, ras al hanout added a flavorful Arab depth to a Thanksgiving classic.",finedining
1732711790.0,Crane Club - Melissa Rodriguez ,"Just had an amazing dinner last night on the 6th night of the restaurants existence. 

A few things worth noting off the bat:

Place is massive as any Tao endeavor would be but still feels super intimate at the same time, spacing is amazing between tables and it never feels loud. 
Service was exceptionally good.
Dining room is extremely cinematic .
Lots of finance bros already swarming it for caviar expense account meals (please god ban down vests lol).

The food :

Breads: pretty outstanding consisting of a butter and salted labne as options for spreads . There is a savory babka, italian bread, and a focaccia like bread. all 8/10 to be 

 
Caviar Bites: we went for the flakey Sfogliatelle and the white truffle arancini. Both of these may have been my favorite bites of the night (esp the arancini)

Cherrystone Clams: Fantastic and 3 to an order but easy enough to split one if you are just two people so you wouldn’t need to order a 4th for 2 each. another favorite

Baked Shells: This was amazing, and i do wish we had tried two pastas but the shells were heavenly, portions at this point are quite large so we were running out hungriness to order more for just 2. this is like a french onion soup meets the best , crispiest shell you’ve have on the outside with the softest and most flavorful inside. 9.5 with the sauce on top too. 

Steak - This was honestly our least favorite part but we wanted to try it anyway. it’s still obviously very good but didn’t feel like it was hot enough or had enough going for it to bring it to the level of everything else (maybe worth going for the t bone next time for a bit more of a show here) ‘Condiments” however were amazing and brought up the steak level a bit higher. (we had the Sauce Choron and Chili oil. 

Maitake Mushrooms : really nice but a bit saucy. 

Dessert: wish we had room for more but we had the lava cake which made me feel 10 years old again in the best way possible. 


Overall, definitely recommend , definitely expensive,  and to me this seems like a more outright “luxury” italian food experience version of torrisi, minus a bit of the storytelling and true ode to new york that torrisi does so well. i’d still pick torrisi over here but this is absolutely worth exploring !

1732587815.0,Best Restaurant in Lima? If we can only choose 1,"Typically, default answer would be Central (#1 in the World and all) but my worry is all the complaints on this sub saying it's gone downhill, and since it now costs ~$500 I'm not sure it's as worth it (not rly price sensitive, but if other places are $200-$300 and taste better I'd rather go to those)

Typically I prefer creativity and capturing the culture of the country first, then taste second (current #1 for me is Disfrutar, for example when I last went last year) but only if it still tastes really good

Maido is a bit 50-50 for me since I'm Asian and travel to Japan the most (since I LOVE the food) so tho I do love Nikkei cuisine, reading some of the complaints here put me off esp for someone that dines in Japan a lot

Kjolle seems to be Central-lite, so I'm 50-50.

Mayta/Merito seem interesting esp if they're more modern Peruvian

Not sure if I'll come back to Peru, so tho I wanna try the others it feels incomplete if I dont at least try Central too (tho we are going to Cusco so I'm tempted to try their restaurant in the Moray ruins if I pick something else in the end)

1732522371.0,MAZ (Tokyo) (**) (November 2024),"The most striking aspect of my meal at MAZ is its collection of cutlery holders - one is made of the dried scales of a fish from Amazon; another a dried octopus. It is one of the most obvious indicators of the chef's commitment to the community, giving the cuisine a distinct sense of place (not to mention a touch of drama). Every opportunity for theatre is milked, be it fire in a dessert or menu cards of different textures. In the scallop dish, the inner layer of the bowl, tinged with blue, is edible, evoking art as something to savour. 
Fine-dining chefs love to tell stories, which may range from the culinary prowess of grandmothers or the soft, pure flavours of water from Mount Fuji. The chef at MAZ is a master of ""show and tell"", starting from the moment customers step into the restaurant - an array of ingredients is on display, including an edible variety of clay. The menu is organised according to the zones where each ingredient can be found, with each dish associated with an altitude. 
Respect for local produce shines through - botan ebi, soft and sweet, makes an appearance and so do clams (in a bracing soup) and sea urchin (in a seaweed tart). The team's enthusiasm is endearing, and I truly want to love MAZ. The thing is, while many dishes are balanced, certain ideas seem to recur - creamy and sour notes, the prevalence of chilli pepper sauces, a love for crispy strands scattered over a dish. It is a pattern I also encounter in Latin American/South American restaurants in Asia, including Mono in Hong Kong and Araya in Singapore. Is it because there are some nuanced aspects such as gradations of crunch or layers of acidity that, due to my tenuous grasp of Latin American food, I do not fully realise? 
Rosy beef on a crispy base is beguiling but falls short of the peaks of pleasure I imagine. The variations of cacao that mark the end of the meal are lovely but I do not find them a drastic improvement on the usual chocolate dessert elsewhere. The kitchen's mastery of techniques is evident - the grape flower in one of the desserts is a triumph of knife skills and a marvel to behold although it may not be a superior alternative to simply eating the grapes as they are.
All things considered, it is a thoughtfully composed meal, underpinned by a coherent narrative and meticulous research. Most of the dishes are enjoyable although few are mind-blowing. Given the range of interesting ingredients the kitchen has access to, it is surprising how familiar the flavours seem. In the end, it is the cutlery holders (and some of the stories) that I remember the most. ",finedining

1732494411.0,"Natsu (1*) - Orlando, Florida ","I ended up having my last night in Orlando free so I decided to see if I could squeeze in one more Michelin meal. I didn’t want to leave Orlando with the disappointing dinner at Capa being the only experience I had outside of work stuff. Fortunately I was able to get a very last minute reservation at Natsu. The following are some of my thoughts: 

- The restaurant was a bit difficult to find as it is seems pretty well hidden. It took me a few minutes until I noticed the red Michelin sign. Inside you’ll find a rather minimalist design but I quite liked it. 

- I didn’t do the sake pairing as I enjoy sushi most with beer but at only $75 for the pairing I regret not doing it. The pours were generous and the person next to me was highly enjoying it. As for the beer they only had 4 choices but they were all pretty unique and tasty (I had them all). I would especially recommend Hitachino Nest Salty-Sour Ale and the Master GAO Jasmine Tea Lager. They both balanced really well with the sushi in my opinion. 

- Service was proper and efficient. It was only the 3 chefs and 1 woman doing all the pairings and drink orders. While the chef was extremely nice to me and conversed quite a bit with me, he did get angry with 2 girls celebrating a birthday there. The chef had asked we eat the sushi quickly once served as the temperature was best, but these girls kept making videos and at one point they had 3 nigiris waiting for them on the plate. 

- Now to the food. Honestly this was one of the better omakases I’ve had in the United States. Every piece of fish tasted great and of high quality. The real star was the rice though. And the flavor and warmth really made the fish pop. And the otsumami were all very fun and a great way to start the meal. 

- The first ostsumami which was the Kegani with a ponzu jelly on the bottom phenomenal. But the real star was the 3rd ostsumami which was kanpachi thin fried potato strips and the shave truffles on top. I love truffles but sometimes I feel they overused. It most certainly wasn’t the case here. It all matched so well. Very fun dish. 

- All the nigiri were great. Kinmedai is always my go to and here it was just excellent. The seared kamasu was the other star in my opinion. One of best sushi bites I’ve had this year. 

- If I were to nitpick anything it would be I wasn’t crazy about the dessert. The cheesecake was tasty but the ice cream had barely any flavor.

- The base price was $180 per person. I ended up paying $296 (omakase, 4 beers, gratuity) which was pretty good value all things considered. 

Overall, I really enjoyed this omakase. There were no noteworthy disappointments. The quality of the fish was great and the rice was spectacular. The otsumami really were fun and for that alone I would go back. Unlike Capa, I can really say they deserve their star.

1732476646.0,NYC - (*) One White Street ,"one white street (*) 

The walk in is very nice experience.
Beautiful three stories of dining rooms. 
The service was amazing and attentive. The Somm was knowledgeable and friendly to speak with, answering all questions from simple novice questions to more complex curious questions. 

1. Foie Gras - citrus explosion. The liver was rich and paired perfectly with the bottle of wine we chose after speaking with the Somm. The fat and citrus really paired well with each other, cutting down on the foie's lingering effect on the mouth

2. American Wagyu with a Fried puff potato. I had a taste of this from my Fiancé. To me this really was a case of order regret. I wanted to switch out my plate with hers. The steak was cooked perfectly as to not disturb the middle of the marbling during cooking. just right enough heat to get the inside juices flowing. Delicate inside fat flavor yet strong flavor on the charred outside. The fried potato ball had an internal surprise with a bit of cinnamon spice and other spices inside. 

3. The Duck - what a dish! two dishes! One was a bowl of grains and duck sausage. Mild sausage flavor, yet tinder and easy to cut. really felt like two meals in one. the actual roasted duck breast was juicy and salted perfectly as the fat melted in mouth. The beets, which i'm not normally a fan of really paired well with the duck. The beats were roasted and really easy to cut into. Highly recommend this dish.

4. The trio in house sorbets. Grape, Cranberry, and apple cider. - perfect way to cut the meal and fat. Really bright. Made our mouths water. 

 5.  The wine, 2020 Proprietary Blend, white, DOMAINE DE LA RANGE DES PÈRES. Coming in at a thick 14% drank like a red. hardy white with a very bright Gold color. I chose this and the Somm agreed, which is always a nice feeling. He chose to decant this wine and keep it on ice for us. Pouring us refreshed glasses at the right time during our meal as to make sure we had enough till the end of our meal.

6. Not pictured was a after dinner wine - dessert wine - lighter and brighter than the dinner's wine

7. Cost: 800 + tip.

1732462374.0,"Sushi Mekumi, Tempura Fukamachi, Maison Kei - Japan Nov 24","Just sharing a short report on the places I ate in my recent Japan trip this month.

Pics 1-5 - Mekumi

Pics 6-10 - Fukamachi

Pics 11-13 - Maison Kei  


**(1)** **Sushi Mekumi (Tabelog Score: 4.52 – Silver 2024) - Kanazawa, Ishikawa Prefecture**

Helmed by Takayoshi Yamaguchi, Sushi Mekumi has been lauded as one of the best sushi restuarants outside of Tokyo showcasing the seafood of the Noto peninsula. This was a place I wanted to try after reading many reviews but lucked out on my earlier March trip to Kanazawa. FOMO hit me hard and managed to score a reservation this round. I had to alter my travel itinerary just to fit this meal and my trip coincided with the start of the crab season in Japan. Our seating was the second day of his November crab course. This was undoubtly an expensive affair, but as explained by Yamuguchi-san, the increased price (from his normal menu) is necessary in order for him to secure the biggest and tastiest crabs of the season. If you are a crab lover, then this will be your heaven.

Dinner consisted of 5 otsumami, 11 pieces of sushi, 1 uni rice bowl and soup. Out of the 5 otsumami, 4 of them were crab-related. And the portions were generous. We had two huge crab legs, one whole hairy crab and one whole small female snow crab each.  These were delicious all round. The sushi was also outstanding. Favourites from the sushi were the smoked nodoguro (this is usually grilled so having it smoked here was eye-opening), the amaebi (meat was so sweet), buri (fatty goodness), anago (melts in your mouth). As Mekumi's seafood sourced primarily from the Noto region, you will not be seeing any of the Toros on his menu. In addition, the shari here is served very warm compared to other sushiyas. This took some timeto get used to but it worked for pieces that were my favourites. For the uni rice bowl, I think the warm shari was a disadvantage and he should have opted for a cooler shari.

Yamaguchi-san is a treat to watch. It was fascinating watching him prepare the crab, using a roller pin to squeeze out the meat from the crab legs in one swift move. Yamaguchi-san is also the most talkative sushi chef I have had the pleasure of dining with. He would often start to monologue even if no one had asked him a question. He does not speak much English so having some Japanese would be desirable if you want to catch his monologues.

Mekumi has two seatings a night (6pm and 8pm), and ours was the first seating. We were seated at 6pm and our meal was completed around 7.30pm (so quite a fast meal). No supplements were offered and I am not sure if he offers supplements for his second seating. Note that Yamaguchi-san only allows photos for his otsumami part of the meal, and there is a strict no photo policy for the sushi. Yamaguchi-san says that the sushi flavour will wane after 3 seconds from preperation, so eating fast is a must.

Overall, this was an excellent meal. My own slight gripe with my meal is that I wished there was a bit more variety in the preperation of his crabs. Two otsumami were boiled crab legs in tomalley sauce and two sushis were boiled crab meat in tomalley sauce over rice (eaten on the hand) and another eaten over seaweed, so the taste profiles were similar. I would definitely come back if I am passing through Kanazawa but I would be more than happy with the normal course in the future.

**Score:** 4.5 / 5

**Cost Performance**: 3 / 5. November crab course is 80k yen per pax (with Tableall fee). You do get quite a lot of crab but even then I think the price is quite steep. If you are a foreigner, Tableall seems to be the only way to reserve so you will have to bear the high booking fees.

**Reservation:** Book through Tableall 4 months in advance. I think reservations are not too difficult to secure if you book early since I only provided one available date to Tableall which they were able to get. It is possible to book Mekumi on [Omakase.in](http://Omakase.in) but you would need a Japanese-number account and I have no visibility on the availability there.

**(2)** **Tempura Fukamachi (Tabelog Score: 4.26 – Bronze 2024) - Tokyo**

Tempura Fukamachi is a one-starred Michelin tempura restaurant a few minutes walk from Kyobashi station. This is helmed by a father and son team. Fukamachi-junior is mainly in charge of frying while Fukamachi-senior was in a more supporting role in cutting the tempura and placing it on our dish. The tempura batter is on the lighter side. Favourites from the meal were the abalone tempura with liver sauce, the seasonal chestnut tempura, the shiitake mushroom tempura and the ten-don. Some dishes were slightly disappointing such as the anago (small pieces and came out abit dry) and the uni in shiso leaf (uni lacked that deep creamy sweetness) but overall it was still a good meal, just do not expect having your mind blown. Service was excellent. They are also very foreigner friendly, the servers and Fukamachi-junior speak very good English. Having eaten here, I do not have a strong desire to visit again but Tempura Fukamachi is an excellent gateway restaurant for high-end tempura omakase. I am still early on my tempura omakase journey and looking to find one in Japan that will blow my mind (anything Tabelog Silver and Gold in Tokyo are almost impossible to book), hopefully I find one in my future trips.

**Score**: 3.5 / 5

**Cost Performance**: 2.75 / 5. We had the most expensive dinner course, which cost about 33k per person. This was quite steep and it did not help that some of the portion sizes were rather small (such as the anago). I think having lunch here would be a much better deal cost wise.

**Reservation:** Book through Autoreserve two months in advance. Reservations should be quite easy to get (during our meal, a foreigner walked-in and managed to secure reservations for a few days later).

**(3)** **Maison Kei (Tabelog Score: 4.09 – Bronze 2024) - Gotemba, Shizouka Prefecture**

Maison Kei is the sister restaurant of Kei Kobayashi's three-Michelin starred Restaurant Kei in Paris. Maison Kei is runned by one of his proteges, Mitsuyoshi Sato. This French restaurant is just a 5 min drive from the Gotemba premium outlet malls, so this was a very nice lunch break on our shopping day. The restaurant has a more relaxed vibe and tables are supposed to have a stunning view of Mount Fuji. Unfortunately, Fuji-san was not agreeable when we dined and was hidden by the clouds. We had the 5-course lunch menu which was excellent value. The signature salad is probably the best salad dish I have ever had. It also has a very unique presentation with the white foam that you have to mix into the salad, turning into a green paste. The rest of the dishes were good but  the main chicken dish was quite lacklustre. This was local chicken that was grilled but was served with jus already poured over and a paprika sauce on the side (which was unnecessary). Overall, good meal but nothing to shout about either.

**Score**: 3 / 5

**Cost Performance**: 4 / 5. The 5-course meal was around 9500 yen before service charge.

**Reservation:** Secured this easily with Tablecheck. You can easily get reservations a few days ahead here.",finedining

On the service and wine side, I really enjoyed that the courses were brought out and explained by different chefs.

1732416246.0,Music & Fine Dining,"A recent post brought up the choice of music at a 2 star restaurant which was playing contemporary r&b, hip hop and pop music.  The music was thought to be incongruous with the food and atmosphere.  As someone who’s worked in restaurants for a while—micro-breweries, 3 star restaurants and everywhere in between—I’ve always been interested in what music was playing in the dining room.  

So I’m curious, what type of music do you like to hear in fine dining?  Have you had any bad experiences?  Good ones?  Is there a specific memory you have connected to a restaurant or dining experience where the  music plays a role?

1732410114.0,"Atera (NYC), an honest review: very disappointing ","Food: this was undoubtedly the most underwhelming 2-star Michelin restaurant we have been to. None of the ingredient pairings seemed to match and we were constantly thinking to ourselves that each dish was significantly average; not a single dish stood out to us, including the desserts. Saga and Aska are astronomically better than Atera. As our dishes were coming out, we wanted to think in a more optimistic manner - but each dish became progressively worse. The caviar soufflé is almost entirely just caviar, the scallops were very average - and lukewarm at that, too - with no flavors standing out, the cheeseball tasted like a frozen treat, the duck breast was very underwhelming and had no taste, the hamachi was just raw fish with the awkwardly paired sauces, and the desserts were just awful. We are hoping we just caught them when their menu wasn’t the best, but needless to say it was very disappointing overall. 

Atmosphere: This was the worst part. The first thing that stood out to us was the music choice. Why am I listening to Rihanna sing about shaking her ass and Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa roll joints while trying to enjoy my food? Don’t get me wrong, I love their music. But the music choice was horrible considering this was a 2 star Michelin restaurant. The venue (we sat Chef’s Counter) is very tightly packed and it’s really easy to overhear our neighbors’ conversations even if we didn’t want to. The bathroom is also poorly managed and not entirely clean. ",finedining

1732344396.0,Oryori Tsuji (Tokyo) (*) (November 2024),"Along the spectrum of Japanese fine dining, Oryori Tsuji leans towards the more traditional end. It still offers a seasonal appetiser platter, which features treasures from both the land (slippery nameko, wheat gluten enriched by notes of caramel and fruit in walnut sauce) and the sea (cured fish roe and smoked kamasu), placed upon scarlet and golden autumn leaves. The sheer quality of produce in Japan means that in the grilled course, the sweet potato, soft and warm, is as compelling as the karei (a type of flounder). Heat is deployed to enchanting effect, in the grilled shirako enrobing sticky rice at the start of the feast, the ebi imo that precedes the rice course, or the soft-crispy chestnut mochi that ends the meal. There are innovative touches such as the rich and tangy ankimo sauce slathered over sashimi. The soup has a dazzling depth, its sweetness and the earthy ginkgo nut beautifully balancing the savoury crab ball. The rice course, in which pearly rice is cooked with shredded grouper, renders efforts at maintaining a low-carb diet futile. Even pickles are prepared with care, their crunch an embodiment of culinary precision. A drawback is the pacing, which can be uneven, but that is a minor quibble in a meal full of marvels.

1732333881.0,Meju - NYC (*),"Meju, run by Chef Hooni Kim, is a Korean Fermentation Studio nestled in a banchan shop in Long Island City, Queens. It gained its first star this past year and I can definitely say it deserves it. I've only seen one prior post on this subreddit, so I wanted to shed some more light on this intimate spot. 

The atmosphere is refined and friendly. Chef Kim is oozing with passion for his art in a way that captivates diners. With each course comes a story -- oftentimes about his experience with his mentor ( a Korean medicine man who taught Chef Kim much of what he knows about the art of fermentation) -- and a mini-science lesson. While espousing the benefits of fermentation initially felt like a gimmick, Chef Kim's earnest passion won me over and I found myself listening with rapt attention each time he spoke up.

Food: (Ratings are from two people, Rating A  & Rating B). I'm writing as the first set of numbers in these.

1. Yeolmu Guksu: 7 & 8. As an opening bite, nothing special. Tasted like it looked.

2. Doenjang + Tofu: 9 & 8. Warm, hearty dish with delicate and silky tofu. Really enjoyed this.

3. Gochujang + Hwe: 8 & 10. Fresh fish with a solid sesame flavor and delicious garnish. 

4. Ganjang + Jeon: 8 & 8. Multiple types of ganjang presented with varying Jeon. The last two jeon were presented with a 125-year old soy sauce. I actually found the flavor of that aged soy sauce overwhelmed by the Jeon, but overall a good dish and cool way to try multiple ganjang.

5. Ssamjang + Beef: 9.5 & 10. Delicious - some of the best cooked beef I've had. Paired with salt and two types of Ssamjang (a comparison between fermentation ages, one recipe being from a commercial farm and the other from Chef Kim's mentor) this was a truly amazing dish.

6. Jeotgal + Pork: 5 & 6. A bit of a let down after the previous course. I found the pork very tough. Didn't like this very much

7. Kimchi / Rice: 8 & 9. Filling home-style meal. Chef Kim touched on how he felt the common Korean meal made by mothers was lost in the fine dining scene. This was his way of bringing light to it. I thought this was good with quality ingredients, but nothing mind-blowing.

8. Sikhye / Red Bean. 9 & 9. Light, refreshing dessert. Notes of cinnamon paired wonderfully with the sikhye. This, per Chef Kim, was somewhat of a combination of three more traditional Korean desserts. 

Service was overall pleasant, with a few minor hiccups. Most notably select guests seemed to receive refills for the banchan with some courses, while others were neglected despite being noticed",finedining

1732193713.0,Japan Food Trip - Nov '24,"Brief recap of a couple of top rated restaurants on my recent trip to Japan with a foodie friend:  

---  

**Sushi Inomata - 4.44 Tabelog Silver**  
Nigiri only, no otsumami, just how I like it. As you probably know this restaurant is a bit of a distance outside central Tokyo, but in my opinion it's absolutely worth it. It's only 35minutes from Shinjuku and that's only 10mins more than it takes to get across to Ginza. Our seating was 4 foreigners, 4 locals, and we were sat next to the door as expected. Unfortunately the two fellow foreigners next to us seemed entirely disinterested in the meal, spent almost the entire course on their phones, and just were not 'present' at all. It's their money, I guess, but I could tell that Inomata-san was disheartened. It was a shame for us as well because we felt a little disconnected from the far more engaged Japanese couples further up the counter. Full credit to Inomata-san's wife who did her best to continually speak to us (in very good English), explaining each course and showing plenty of interest in our journey.  
Rant over, onto the food. We were served a constant stream of incredible nigiri. Many of the pieces here we had not tried before so we were able to expand our horizons, and knowing the quality on offer, we were expanding at the top. The aging was great, imo, and gave a new layer of flavour to some of the most common neta that we'd tried. Hon-maguro was incredible as expected - worth the train journey for that alone. The sake on offer was premium but without the premium price tag and enhanced the flavours of many of the nigiri. We were offered an additional menu at the end to add optional extra nigiris, though it was only a few of the fish which I presume he had extra of on the day - no option to dine on more tuna unfortunately.

Price: Y60,000 (inc. drinks) making this the most expensive meal of our trip.  

**Verdict:** 8/10. At this price I think you need to be a true sushi connoisseur to get your moneys worth here. We enjoyed it all the same, but if I am really honest with myself, I am perhaps not far enough along my own sushi journey to truly appreciate the nuances which Inomata-san delivers. Also, the meal is no-frills - and that's absolutely fine its not a criticism at all, merely an observation. No regrets, but I don't think I'd go again until I am better educated.  

---  

**Sushi Sanshin - 4.49 Tabelog Gold**  
Wow. Let's just start with that. This was possibly the most impressive meal I've ever had. If you arrive sufficiently early (it's Japan, so ofcourse you did) then you are welcomed into a beautiful tea room to unwind and mentally prepare - I felt this was an *excellent* touch, as often I am ever-so-slightly flustered upon arrival after having navigated urban Japan and checking my phone/directions/timing constantly. Upon entering you see that the restaurant is stunning; it is spacious and so well naturally lit. The operation whirrs into action and it is far more significant compared to Inomata's husband & wife team, with multiple sou-chefs buzzing around with typically Japanese flawless co-ordination. The taisho spoke serviceable English and multiple of the sou-chefs spoke excellent English which made us feel more welcome. We were centrally seated and surrounded by locals - lucky us!  
Over the next 2+ hours we were served 6 otsumami and ~13 nigiri. Enough people have written food reviews better than me so I won't try to explain but I can tell you how it made me feel which was simply fantastic. It felt like there was slightly more experimentation in the nigiri than I was expecting - salt on the tuna, zest on the gizzard shad - but it worked for me. Overall, it felt like a very well rounded dining experience, punctuated by some of the best seafood and sushi I've eaten.  
At the end of the course we were given the option to add more nigiri and we could order from an even wider menu than what we were initially served omakase - there must have been 35 different options available. I won't lie - we gorged. The locals ate 1-2 pieces each and one-by-one took their leave from the restaurant while my friend & I kept being served. For a moment I felt bad for keeping the taisho behind but he seemed to enjoy our enjoyment. We ended up staying for perhaps another 30 minutes and talking casually with the taisho and the senior sou-chef, both of whom had recently visited England and were happy to talk travel and then give us a few insights into the world of owning and operating a successful sushi restaurant. This was perhaps the highlight of an already favourite personal experience.  
We finally waddled out stuffed with sushi and were welcomed back into the tea-room to decompress and enjoy a sweet dessert - a simple yet gorgeous mochi grape and green tea. Again, this tea-room wonderfully bookends the meal and lets the experience breathe.  

Price: Y36,000 initial fee (inc. Tableall Y8k booking fee) + Y10,500 on extras & drinks.  

**Verdict:** 10/10. If sushi meals get better than this then I can't wait to experience them.

**Tachiguizushi Akira - 3.70**  
A different style to the above as a no-frills standing sushi, not fine dining, but I am quickly squeezing this in to provide a comparison. This was al a carte, order once upon arrival, not omakase. In an hour we ate ~18 nigiri and we thought that the sushi on offer here was excellent, especially at the price point. Perhaps it is a reflection of our sushi understanding, but I judge a clear gulf between this level of sushi and everything below it, and not a hugely significant jump to the tier above.  

Price: Y11,000 all-in  

**Verdict:** Considering price this is a 9.5/10 because the sushi is absolutely excellent, comparable to places x3-4 the price. Price excluded and on a fine dining scale, it's probably a 5/10 as there is limited service, no frills, you're standing up, it's quite cramped - this is 100% focus on food so it can't really compare to the above restaurants as an overall dining experience, and that's fine.  

**Sushi thoughts:** As well as the 3 above reservations we also visited multiple conveyor sushi and walk-in standing sushi's as we wanted to experience the spectrum of quality, and I'm really glad we did this. We ate sushi nearly every day for two weeks, moving deliberately up and down the Tabelog rankings from 3.3 to 3.5, to 3.8, all the way up to Gold award winners, we gained a true appreciation of how the craft evolves and improves. For us the sweet spot was definitely Tachiguizushi Akira and if I lived in Tokyo I could see myself becoming a regular at this tier of price-performance ratio.  
 
---  

**Yakiniku Jambo Hanare - 4.30 Tabelog Silver**  
This was the best beef course I've ever eaten - again, let's just get that out of the way. The restaurant is in a low-key suburb and, like many top end restaurants in Tokyo, you could walk right past it (and we did). We were accompanied by one fellow foreign couple and a local couple. The staff spoke good English and I suspect they are accustomed to international visitors. The restaurant doesn't feel fancy at all, and it isn't, it's all about the food. Course is a low frills omakase course navigating different cuts of beef, cooked infront of you, served with various complimentary dips. Cuts are thick and thin, offering something for everyone. The Noharayaki (marinated sirlion dipped in raw egg) might be the single best mouth of food I've had in my life ... I can still taste it and I long for my chance to experience it again. I've been lucky to dine at a lot of good European steak restaurants for many years now, and this was undeniably very different, but to me, superior. The meat was treated and served with care and reverence in a way that I can not compare. I would return in a heartbeat, and I feel compelled to try other similar restaurants.  

Price: Y22,000  

**Verdict:** 9/10. The food that we had was incredible, though I wouldn't have said no to another course or two. I also wouldn't have minded a tad more carbs to mix up the palette slightly.  

---  

The rest of our meals I don't think I could justify posting on r/finedining but among them were some of the best meals I've ever had. These include multiple of the top rated ramens in Tokyo and top rated Tonkatsu which was the best tasting pork of my life - I honestly don't know how they do it.

1732155910.0,"Capa (1*) - Orlando, Florida","Had to come to Orlando for work so I decided to squeeze in a couple of Michelin restaurants between meetings to explore the scene. Capa Steakhouse wasn’t my first choice but it was the only one with reservations late at night on the date I arrived (and it was conveniently located in the Four Seasons). I ordered a la carte as they don’t have a set menu (or at least didn’t that night). The following are the dishes I had and some of my general thoughts:

1st dish. Bacon wrapped dates stuffed with almonds and tamarind. The drink is their house margarita. The dates were actually quite good. Nice little way to start the dinner. The star here was the margarita actually. And I almost never drink or like margaritas by waiter insisted I try it and it was awesome. Nice and spicy. 

2nd dish. Pork belly in apple butter and a pistachio jazz. It was pretty average. It sounded better than it was. The flavors were rather muted, especially the apple butter. 

3rd dish. Jamón serrano croquetas in an onion soubise. Extremely disappointing. I typically love croquetas, but these I couldn’t even finish. The texture was that of an overfried mozzarella stick. And it completely lacked any flavor. 

4th dish. Ibérico pluma (end loin) with a marcona almond romesco and Valencia orange. It was pleasant surprise given the last couple of dishes. Tender. Full of flavor. Perfectly seasoned and cooked. The romesco really worked with it well balancing the fatiness of the plums. Highly recommend it. 

5th dish. Tomatoes with cucumbers in a smoked garlic vinaigrette. By far the best thing I had all dinner. I could eat that vinaigrette like soup. And it was the perfect accompaniment to the pluma. 

Dessert. Chocolate lava cake with cajeta on the inside with dulce de leche around it and banana ice cream. I could eat that everyday for dessert the rest of my life. There isn’t much to guess here. All the major ingredients made delicious sense and they executed it to perfection. 

- My server was great. Very attentive, engaging, but also seemed very relaxed which i enjoyed given the late dinner by myself. 
- The view was quite impressive and the fireworks shows were a pleasant surprise. 
- I’m not sure how I feel about the inside of the restaurant. I’m not trying to nitpick but it felt almost too big and open. The terrace is quite nice though. And very comfortable. 
- I’m not crazy about the plating and the table felt quite empty.
- Prices weren’t bad at all. It was just me. Food, the margarita, a glass of wine, a glass of sherry, and mineral water all for $265 including tip. 

Overall, the dishes I enjoyed mostly made up for the dishes I didn’t. I also don’t think I ordered all too well. There is something about Spanish pork dishes that gets me excited but I could’ve definitely mixed it up more with some seafood and maybe that could’ve helped make a more enjoyable meal. All things considered though I don’t think is a very noteworthy Michelin star restaurant. I’m obviously don’t know better than the actual judges but in my opinion this is one of those restaurants for me where I don’t think they deserve the star. ",finedining

Service
In keeping with the atmosphere, this was very relaxed and more modern than some fine dining establishments. Attentive without being overbearing

Course 1
WAGYU PT. 1
A5 wagyu fat butter / sesame loaf / shiso

Super beefy butter, warm bread with great flavour. Not sure what the shiso added

Course 2
WAGYU PT. 2
wagyu neck / truffle / jerusalem artichoke / hazelnut

Rich tender beef, full flavoured. Earthy veloute added by the pops of mushrooms. Texture added by the crisps. Hazelnuts added texture and a nice sweetness, that kept with the earthy autumn flavours
	
Course 3
WAGYU PT. 3""Surf & Turf""
Japanese A5 Wagyu steak / obsiblue prawn / XO sauce

Beautifully cooked wagyu, do sauce added a complex flavour. Spice from the kimchee carrots built and built. Crispy prawn was nice but overpowered flavour wise by the beef, sauce and kimchi

6 or 7 slices of tender sweet scallop. Hits if sweetness from the sweetcorn dashi, along with a great spice from the furikake, lemongrass and chilli coming through softly

Course 5
WILD HALIBUT
pumpkin/sturia caviar / brown shrimp / smoked salmon

Perfect halibut, crisp on one side and tender flakes. Caviar and smoked salmon added a nice pop and hit. Brown shrimps add sweetness, rounded off by the sweet, earthy, creamy pumpkin sauce, which ended up like a rich chowder with the remains of the toppings

Course 6

merguez sausage / ajo blanco / chorizo & coco beans salsa

Tender sweet lamb, earthy beans and nice hint of garlic from the ajo Blanco. Merguez gently spiced, lingered without blowing your head off. Super seasonal and well balanced

Course 7
SCOTTISH VENISON LOIN
haggis pie / crapaudine beetroot / parsley root / preserved blackberries

Rich earthy venison, super intense jus. Nicely sweet parsnip puree and crisp. Pickled blackberry added a nice sharpness. Hagiss pie was missing some texture in the pastry, but the filling was well spiced and flavoured

Warm sweet frangipane cake, sweet tart apple slices and a refreshing blackberry coulis on top. Refreshingly sharp apple parfait

Rich and sweet fondant, nice salty hit from the miso caramel

My husband has been wanting to go to Le Manoir for years, so a few weeks ago for his 30th, we finally went and stayed a night. I know this is fine dining and not fine hotels but it is without a doubt the nicest and most luxurious hotel we have ever been to, and the whole evening was one of the best experiences we have ever had.


We went for the full tasting menu and the classic wine pairing (menu in the final photo).


Photo 1 - Cocktail in the lounge. We had a very nice cocktail each (but alas cannot remember the names) and got some complimentary olives and almonds. No idea if this part is because we were staying at the hotel or if everyone goes to the lounge first before moving to the dining room. 


Photo 2 - Canapes to start the evening which were served a few minutes after we were taken to our table. One was a steak tartare type thing, one was a beetroot macaron, and the other was tuna. Not the most memorable parts of the meal, but good enough. Have had better elsewhere (hello Core), but still good.


(not pictured) - The bread. Amazing choice of bread, and I foolishly had another serving when offered which meant I was very full at the end. I had the tomato and garlic which was incredible, and the potato and ale (I think) which was also very good.


Photo 3 - Chicken Liver Parfait with Pear and Balsamic. Wasn't actually a huge fan of this dish. The parfait was perhaps a bit too rich and the pear did not cut through it enough. Looking back, I wish I'd thought to pair this with the bread rather than eating the bread separately. Not bad by any means, but not the best for my palate (husband however disagreed and loved it).


Photo 4 - Le Saumon - Loved this dish. All of the little bits were just perfect. The third best seafood dish I have ever had (and spoiler alert, by second and first place come later in this meal). The creme fraiche pearls were fun and a bit different. I got a bit nervous with buttermilk being mentioned on the menu as I don't get along too well with sour, but this was all brilliant and I wish I could have it again right now.


Photo 5 - Le Foire De Canard - My husband upgraded to this dish instead of the salmon and he loved his just as much as I loved the salmon.


Photo 6 - La Coquile St-Jacques - My husband's favourite course of the meal and my second favourite. Staff told us that the scallop is often on the menu with different accompaniments, but with the pumpkin foam and pumpkin seeds it seemed to be perfect. A few absolutely perfect mouthfuls. Loved it.


Photo 7 - Le Loup De Mer - Sea bass, onions, and cheese. I was unsure about cheese with fish, but this was my favourite seafood dish I have ever had. Don't really have much to say other than I loved it.


Photo 8 - Le Canard - The only bit I was less sure about with this dish was the fig. Fig flavour worked well, but the big piece of fig was perhaps a bit much? Other than that, loved it. Not sure what part of the duck had the poppy seeds, but it was incredibly tasty and almost chinese a bit in its spicing. Excellent dish and my husband was relieved that he didn't upgrade this dish to the venison as he loved the duck.


(not pictured) - La Poirie - Sadly I forgot to take a picture (a lot of wine has been consumed by this point) but this was a really good dessert Pear ginger and pastry. I'm not much of a dessert person, more of a pastry and cake fan, but this was delicious.


Photo 9 and 10 - Le Cacao Et Le Cafe & Le Cafe Creme - These were both fine. Got a candle in one for my husbands birthday, and we split these 2 desserts between us. They both tasted very similar, so the upgrade to the caffe creme doesn't really change what goes in your mouth, just the way it is presented. As mentioned, not a huge dessert guy, and this was probably my least favourite course, but absolutely nothing actually wrong with it. Probably just not hugely to my tastes. 


Photo 11 - Petis Fours - All great. We retired to the lounge for these and our coffee (I think this only happened if you were staying at the hotel, otherwise you had it in the dining room. Could be wrong). We'd had a lot of wine, but these were a great little ending. 


Bonus photo 12 - Breakfast is included if you stay, and it's excellent. Lots of options of things to order and also a continental selection. Also Raymond Blanc happened to be there that morning so my husband got to say hi to him, which made his day. 


We left very full, very tipsy, and very glad we only had to go up some stairs and fall into bed. 


All in all, excellent meal, excellent experience, and excellent service. Basing it purely on the food, its up there with some of the best we've ever had, although for me Core by Claire Smyth beats it, and for service/experience I think the Ritz is more special, but for a combination of brilliant food, amazing service, and an excellent overall experience, not sure Le Manoir can be beaten (especially if you are staying overnight).

1731871018.0,Jordnær*** Copenhagen ,"When food becomes art and worth more than a special journey

Welcome back to chasing stars, the series where I visit the worlds best restaurants. 

For todays episode, we are visiting a restaurant close to my heart - Jordnær in Copenhagen. 

Jordnær isn’t just a restaurant—it’s an act of reverence, a love letter to nature, and a quiet celebration of humility. The name itself—“Down to Earth”—says it all. And that’s what Eric Vildgaard and Tina Kragh , have created. They don’t just run a restaurant; they’ve built a home. They call Jordnær their “seventh child,” a labor of love that extends far beyond the kitchen and dining room. It’s family, passion, and the kind of devotion you don’t often see in the polished world of michelin stars.

Since opening in 2017, they have climbed the ranks with a speed that can only be described as extraordinary. Nine months in, they scored their first Michelin star. By 2020, they had their second. And in 2024, they hit the pinnacle—a third Michelin star. In a city already brimming with culinary talent, they’ve carved out a space that demands attention. But how did they get there? For me, the answer’s clear: it’s not just about the food, it’s about the whole damn experience. From the moment Tina and Eric greet you at the door to that first sip of champagne, you realize they’ve built something rare—genuine, welcoming, and undeniably special.

1731867431.0,"Went to Guy Savoy (2*) in Paris, and kind of embarrassed myself ","I thought I would share a story of me being embarrassing because I had never been to a Michelin star restaurant before. My fiance surprised me for my birthday so I had no idea what he planned. I was treated very well and the service was great. However, I was trying so so hard to not be perceived as a dumb rude American, that I kept saying ""merci"" every time they brought something to the table. Water, forks, food, I said thank you, merci, etc. I said it so much that when the server placed soup in front of me, he whispered in my ear and said ""That's enough"" kind of with a smile but I wasn't sure what tone he meant it in. I think he could tell I had never done this before since we look pretty young and I looked super uncomfortable and out of my element. So he was probably just trying to help me out. 

Anyway, I was so horrified that I laughed and stopped saying merci unless they said it first and finally when we left. I have since learned that trying too hard to be polite made me look less polite. Let this be a lesson to you all that saying thank you too much is annoying, especially if they have to hear you say merci with a terrible American accent.

1731854508.0,"Tenzushi Kyomachi, Tabelog 4.59, Gold, Kokura","Tenzushi is the most highly acclaimed Sushi restaurant that I have ever been to and it is also different than any other places that I have visited. There are 2 things that make this place stand out. 

First, their unique style of producing Sushi. I think traditional Sushi places pursue perfection with so many restrictions. It is extremely minimalistic. So, in order to make better Sushi, other places try adjusting the temperature of shari, thickness of the neta, the ratio between shari and su, changing the aging process, how to store the neta and etc. So many subtle tweaks under the radar and those things all make Sushi such an interesting work of art. But Tenzushi ignores or circumvents those notion. They straight up change the sauce -they are famous for using Kabosu infused sauce instead of traditional shoyu, for instance- and add sub ingredient over more sub ingredient, whatever it takes to achieve the target taste. I found it is actually quite intuitive and interesting. Basically, what I felt was anything that has more than one thing on top of the neta, it is guaranteed that it would be great. 

Second, they do not serve alcohol. Only nigiri from start to finish, all the way through. I actually asked Taisho regarding why. He answered me that by having alcohol and Tsumami, one would deprive themselves of appreciating more nigiri because humans have limits to how much foods they have. And the inventor of Tenzushi’s Kyushu-mae -as apposed to traditional Edo-mae-, the father of the current Taisho was felt serving alcohol is almost a cheating, quotes from Taisho was “Because it’s Sushi place, not alcohol and etc place”. While not serving alcohol indicates Tenzushi does not f around about their nigiris, it actually affects the duration of the meal too. It is quite shorter than the other places. TMI, the conversation about the shorter duration of the meal led to the no alcohol policy.

 Details of the course are following

 1. Chutoro, Bluefin tuna, marinated with Kabosu infused soy sauce from Shiogama

 2. Ootoro, fattiest belly portion from tuna, also from Shiogama

 3. Their signature, white caviar on top of sea urchin on top of Akaika squid, five different colors of sesames sprinkled on them. My favorite of the evening #1-

 4. Kuruma ebi, Tiger prawn

 5. Shime saba, Aged mackerel, Kelp, diced pickled ginger and spring onions, my favorite piece of the evening #2

 6. Hotate, Japanese scallop

 7. Kamasu, Barracuda, grilled to enhance the fattiness of the fish, more umami

 8. Tachiuo, Cutlass fish, served with Bainiku -plum based sauce

 9. Maguro zuke, didn’t take picture unfortunately, too busy devouring

 10. Kisu, Northen whiting, first time having it raw. I have only had the fritter of it. This actually served with Yuzu Kosho, instead of typical wasabi. Taisho told me that he wanted ‘different spiciness’.

 11. Shirako, Sperm sac of Fugu, seasonal delicacy that came earlier than usual. Super creamy. 

 12. Yaito katsuo, Binoto, served with ginger

 13. Sazae, conch, served with Okra, This was the most unfamiliar combination among all, I think. 

 14. Head of Kuruma ebi, Taisho actually served this in Korean saying 새우머리

 15. Amadai, Sweet seabream, served with its liver piece. First time having sea bream liver. Compared to Yankimo, it breaks more easily so that gets mixed with the fillet more easily too. My favorite piece #3

 16. Anago, Salt water eel, massive piece of it

 17. Toro Maki, Ground tuna belly meat served with white onion. On summer, they serve sea grape instead.

 18. Tamago Yaki, honey and sugar mixture to sweeten it.

 19. The dessert.

1731820265.0,Saison (**) - SF - November 2024,"Last night I thoroughly enjoyed my first Michelin dining experience with many thanks to the reviews and recommendations in this sub. About a year ago my husband jokingly asked for a two or three star meal to celebrate his 30th birthday and with a little planning I realized, why not make it happen? 

We narrowed our search to SF due to proximity and the number of ptions and this sub led us to choose Saison. At first glance I worried the dishes would be a little too out there for me (I’d never had caviar, organ meat, etc before yesterday) but wowww a meal and experience that exceeded expectations. 

While I was prepared for incredible service and attention to detail, experiencing it first hand was something else entirely. Saison excelled at providing that perfectly-curated fine dining experience but in a completely unpretentious way. Staff was lightheaded and attentive while pop hits from the likes of Madonna and Michael Jackson played in the background at just the right volume to convey “it’s cool, it’s just dinner.” The decor was organic and simple and we enjoyed a view right into the open kitchen. Hell, even the bathrooms were memorable (already snapped a picture of and purchased their candles)

Food was, of course, stunning. Favorites included the black cod dish and the caviar with squash. The brioche and tea courses were surprising in their execution and simplicity. Hot take but the popular uni toast was definitely my least favorite bit. Husband added the A5 wagyu supplement and received an 8 layer lemon cake as a birthday extra- both of which were dreamy. 

 “Sureeal” is the word that continues to come to mind, and I fear I may have just ruined myself for all other meals! I’m officially a fine dining fan and just glad all my lurking has paid off! ",finedining

1731730528.0,"Xocol, Guadalajara ","Top tier tasting menu for the price point (~$85). I actually liked it MUCH better than the more expensive and more renowned Alcalde. They also have an a la carte menu that is very reasonable, but as a solo diner I don’t find much appeal in a la carte as I have no one to split dishes with and therefore can’t try much. 

First off, the space is beautiful and service is excellent. The staff KNOWS you. I was called by my name the entire meal. 

There were some seriously amazing bites during the meal. There was a smoked oyster in butter that was an all-time great bite for me. Some of the moles were lick-the-plate good (one fish dish in particular stands out). Others, for example a crab and corn dish, fell flat, but at least felt inventive enough where I felt like they were still operating on all cylinders. 

The main downsides for me:
1) No print menu for the tasting. This drives me crazy. I understand that it could change day-to-day, but it’s such a fundamental ask imo that it’s bonkers when fine dining places don’t have one
2) Wines by the glass were basically nonexistent. There was one red, one orange, and one white that were offered by the glass, and neither the orange or the white were on the wine list. I don’t want to be a cheap ass when doing a tasting menu but also, I would like to know how much a wine costs when ordering it?
3) The sweet/savory balances of the courses were off. There was no real “dessert” (a palate cleanser was followed by a sorbet/granita and a minuscule amuse) yet I was stuffed to the brim with savory courses to the extent that the people across from me (who ordered a la carte) were laughing at how much they were feeding me 

Nonetheless, it was a good meal, and phenomenal considering the price. Would absolutely recommend. ",finedining
1731715929.0,"Two weeks in Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka - L'Effervescence, Velrosier, Takyama and others","I would like to preface this post with the fact I speak VERY basic Japanese so my experience with service might be different to yours. At any restaurant that isn't catered towards foreigners, the way staff and chefs treat you  completely changes if you speak even basic Japanese as a foreigner.

**Tokyo:**

Meino [(pictures)](https://imgur.com/a/meino-smV3tVA) : Tabelog 4.0( however this is a relatively new restaurant and the score distributions except for cost performance are all above 4.5; this is easily at the level of a Tabelog silver if not gold). Mei-san is an alum of Sushi Arai and she makes absolutely amazing sushi. There is also an excellent wine list and the service is excellent - Mei-san speaks excellent English and the restaurant atmosphere is upscale without being stuffy or overly quiet. This was easily the best sushi of my life and one of the best meals of my life. Reservations are members only.

Takiya [(pictures)](https://imgur.com/a/takiya-vrENfoN) : Tabelog Gold and regarded as the best tempura restaurant in Japan, this was one of the best meals of my life. I would put it on the level of El Celler can de Roca and Mosu. Absolutely amazing what Tatsuaki-san is able to accomplish purely with tempura and the sake recommendations are excellent. Chef is the only one who can speak English here - the waitstaff all speak very limited English. This is a very difficult reservation, most reservations are to members but from what I have heard it is possible through Tableall if done well in advance.

Ginza Ooishi [(pictures)](https://imgur.com/a/ginza-oiishi-bLxDtp0) : Tabelog Silver. This is French/Japanese fusion tasting menu that is absolutely amazing. This would be an amazing first fine dining experience for anyone interested - the food is very approachable for being fine dining. The chef is also extremely entertaining and the entire restaurant is super lighthearted - you can tell the staff are all having fun cooking. There is only one waiter/sommelier and he speaks decent English. Reservation is very easy through Omakase.

L'Effervescence [(pictures)](https://imgur.com/a/l-eff-2vjNah6) : 3 Michelin Stars and a Green star. Funnily enough, I dined here a day after that post on r/finedining talking about how it does not deserve three stars and I could not disagree more. This was an amazing meal focused on vegetables - IMO better than Noma's vegetable season. Service is absolutely amazing as well - I was even offered a tour of the kitchen at the end of my meal when I expressed interest. I would like to say this is absolutely not French food - this is Japanese food with French influences. If you go in expecting rich French dishes you will be very disappointed. My best description would be imagine you are going through the best farmer's market in the world eating dishes that show off their produce in the best ways possible.

Sushi Marufuku [(pictures)](https://imgur.com/a/sushi-marufuku-MbaXF5Z) : Tabelog 3.65 (note that all the categories except drinks and cost performance are above a 4.0). Very solid sushi that focuses on aged fish. The staff all also speaks excellent English and managed to accommodate for me running 30 minutes late. Would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a very good Omakase experience that comes with excellent English service.

Yakitori Shinohara [(pictures)](https://imgur.com/a/yakitori-shinohara-nODHZUk) : Tabelog 3.84. This is a yakitori restaurant that serves Takasaka chicken which is the only chicken in the world that can safely be eaten raw. The only reason I booked this restaurant was so I can try this chicken - and honestly it's pretty good. The yakitori is extremely tender while still having a great char due to not having to overcook the chicken. However, the drinks here are very very overpriced and honestly the meal itself is very expensive for being yakitori. Sadly all the top end yakitori places are extremely hard to get reservations at so you are pretty much relegated to the second tier of restaurants which include places like Shinohara. This is still a solid meal, just overpriced. I would really only recommend it if you want to try raw chicken safely.

Notable non fine dining:

L'epicurien [(pictures)](https://imgur.com/a/l-epicurien-ISHfCCo) : amazing bakery in Kichijoji, it is cash only and there is no dine-in option so you will have to find somewhere to eat the pastries quickly. I had to just jump into a random ramen restaurant to eat them.

Mamezou [(pictures)](https://imgur.com/a/mamezou-ilBl1KB) : great curry with a lot of vegetables mixed in. Apparently there can be a pretty long wait sometimes but I went at opening time for dinner and was seated instantly.

**Kyoto:**

Gion Nishi [(pictures)](https://imgur.com/a/gion-nishi-yrYymWI) : Tabelog Bronze kaiseki. Compared to other high end kaiseki restaurants in Kyoto, this was much cheaper which is why I went with it and I do not regret it at all. Food, service and drinks are all excellent and the ingredients are all still very high quality. They also used to run a cafe and you can definitely tell with the excellent tea and dessert course. This was an extremely easy reservation - their counter is also only 6 seats so you will get an excellent view of the chefs at work. I would highly recommend this for anyone looking for a high end kaiseki.

Takayama [(pictures)](https://imgur.com/a/takayama-UP2jjR1) : 1 Michelin star. Amazing Italian tasting menu with Japanese influences. If you dine here, make sure you have a very light lunch - this is a VERY large meal. The chef and staff all speak excellent English and there is also Mandarin speaking staff as well. This is peak 1 star cuisine - its great tasting food that is great value for the price and a great atmosphere that isn't stuffy. This would be a great introduction to fine dining.

Velrosier [(pictures)](https://imgur.com/a/velrosier-dkMt70C) : 2 Michelin stars. Chinese tasting menu with western influences. Extremely great value for a 2 star restaurant with very solid food. Service is amazing. I do think this restaurant is overrated by r/finedining but I have seen posts saying this place is awful - I very much disagree and think it is still very good food. This is literally opposite Takayama but the atmosphere is much more formal - personally I preferred both the food and atmosphere at Takayama but I would still say this is good food. This is also another restaurant that I think would make a great introduction to fine dining especially if you prefer a more upscale atmosphere.

Sushi Saeki [(pictures)](https://imgur.com/a/sushi-saeki-DpKBJPH) : Tabelog 3.7. I really only booked this because I saw a post on this sub and it was right by my hotel (The Mitsui which is the best hotel I have ever stayed at) and was very much craving sushi. This was the most disappointing meal of my trip. The service is amazing and the garden view is beautiful but the sushi was just not worth the price. I think I was being served by the sous chef however?? so this might be much better when served by the main chef. That being said, I cannot recommend a lunch booking here in good faith.

Sakana to Yakitori to Kappo to Tototo [(pictures)](https://imgur.com/a/sakana-to-yakitori-to-kappo-to-tototo-wl1mXUF) : Tabelog 3.24 but a relatively new restaurant. I booked this restaurant on a whim, and ended up with such a great meal. The sushi is solid but the star of the show is the sake - the sake recommendations here are AMAZING. The place was also only manned by one chef when I visited late at night and he was extremely nice to talk to. Great value for the price - would recommend for anyone looking for a great late night meal.

Gibier Miyama [(pictures)](https://imgur.com/a/gibier-miyama-u3VbQGI) : Tabelog 3.92. If you do not like game meat, do not bother eating here. Everything on the menu is either game meat or extremely fishy fish. Service here also completely changed when they found out I could speak basic Japanese. That being said, as someone who loves game meat, fishy fish and has a SO who loves hunting this meal was amazing. The venison and boar here are AMAZING. This was also my first time having bear meat - it is VERY fatty which I am not a fan of but if you enjoy fatty meats you will enjoy the bear meat here. Great value for the price as well - go here with an empty stomach/light lunch as there is a lot of food. Highly recommend this if you are a fan of game meat.

**Osaka:**

Katsuya Charcoal Grill Steakhouse [(pictures)](https://imgur.com/a/katsuya-steakhouse-R2Mk1Mb) : Tabelog 3.62. I was looking for a wagyu place in Osaka on tableall and this was listed so I booked it on reflex. Honestly, this isn't really somewhere you should go if you are looking for a wagyu experience. This is, however, an amazing steakhouse. I have not been to a steakhouse in forever since I stopped seeing the value but this was very much worth it. Everyone here speaks great English and the restaurant is members only which is shown in how friendly the atmosphere here is. Absolutely perfect steak, amazing dessert and a very tasty salad. The biggest issue is that I just don't see the value here when you add on the Tabelog fee - but if anyone here has friends in Osaka that are members here and can get a reservation at normal price, this is a very good meal.

Sushi Hinoki [(pictures)](https://imgur.com/a/sushi-hinoki-LPEHggE) : Tabelog 3.60, very good sushi with extremely funny staff. This was one of my favorite meals of my trip, the head chef is genuinely so funny and his staff all compliment his comedy well. The sushi here is VERY good as well and their sake recommendations were great. The head chef speaks solid English but this would be much more enjoyable if you speak Japanese as all the comedy is in Japanese. That being said even if you don't speak Japanese, I would still highly recommend this restaurant on the strength of its sushi alone.

Tempura Ando [(pictures)](https://imgur.com/a/tempura-ando-nQ1af9Z) : Tabelog 3.63. Unique tempura that is fried in extra virgin olive oil. Ate here for lunch and it was very good food. Service here is excellent - the other party here was a family who was celebrating a birthday and they got a special dessert at the end. There's really not much to say here, it's just a solid tempura omakase that is uniquely fried in olive oil instead of the usual sesame oil or vegetable oil. 

Omi Gyuu Senmon Ten Manyou Maeda Tei [(pictures)](https://imgur.com/a/omi-gyuu-senmon-ten-manyou-maeda-tei-Yup06oS) : Tabelog 3.4. I wanted to try A5 Wagyu, Sukiyaki and yakiniku and this restaurant provided all 3. It's expensive for what it is but the meat is good and the desserts and drinks are solid. To be honest, l would skip the sukiyaki and purely stick to yakiniku if you dine here. I am also sure there are probably much better value restaurants that you can find if you book in advance but I booked this last minute on a craving. It's good but overpriced.

Non fine dining:

Pokemon Cafe [(pictures)](https://imgur.com/a/pok-mon-cafe-osaka-Py8RQUP) : HOLY SHIT this is one of the hardest reservations I have ever tried to get. There's not much to say, the only reason to ever go here is if you are a Pokemon fan. Very overpriced food that I would never eat again but worth the one time experience as a massive Pokemon fan.

Pizzeria da Tigre [(pictures)](https://imgur.com/a/pizzeria-da-tigre-szgrBQe) : Another pizzeria that is listed as a top 50 pizzeria in Asia, This is good pizza but I preferred the dough at Ciro.

This establishment has everything it takes to get me hooked. It has unique taste backed by the locally sourced ingredients. The place has surprisingly good cost/performance ratio as well. The 10 dishes course costed me 123 dollars including 2 non-alcoholic beverages, caviar add-on and the service charge. 

 Detail of the courses are following:

 1. Set of 4 appetizer, Salmon caviar served with pastry stick on bottom, blue crab with butter nut mousse, consommé and spring onion gelee on the center, Scallop tart with charcoal powder sprinkled on top and lastly, pork pate served with peanuts foam.

2. Ashi-Aka shrimp, served with lemon mousse, avocado, wasabi sauce and gelee’d tomato.

3. Freshily smoked Okyhyuga Salmon, served with crepe and French caviar as an add-on.

4. Torched Skipjack Tuna served with charcoal grilled eggplant.

5. My favorite of the evening, Anago fritter, served on top of rice. The rice reminds me of Italian risotto, but quite evidently french thanks to the fragrance of the butter. Japanese chestnut and ginko nut inside the rice was the nice surprise too. It reminded me of the rice portion I had at Oishi, Ginza. Both of them were made with the traditional Japanese delicacies, but successfully identifying themselves as french. 

6. Fugu fish, served with various mushrooms including sliced truffle on top. 

7. Main dish, venison steak, served with sauce made with venison broth and various embellishments. 

8. First dessert. Foam made with maple and fig, glazed orange, vanilla ice cream and creme brulee’d fig. 

9. Main dessert, shine musket slices, frozen champagne slices, honey mousse and yogurt gelato

As a whole, it wasn’t the absolute best food we had during our trip — tough competition, truly — but it had one of our absolute favorite dishes. The total experience of feeling like you’re at a chefy friend’s house, and the memorably unique approach to Japanese cuisine really made this worth all the waiting and hype. “Joyful fine dining” is really refreshing in a world full of “The Menu”-style very serious chefs.

1731596492.0,"Hinode (Kuwana, Japan) - Nov 2024","I had the pleasure of dining at Hinode (日の出) a week ago, which is currently a Tabelog Bronze awardee. This is a Ryotei located in the town of Kuwana, Mie Prefecture, which is famous for Hamaguri clams. 

There are a variety of courses that can be ordered but we went with their signature clam hotpot course. Our dining party of four had a private room to ourselves and the hotpot dishes were prepared table side by our server. Service was excellent as expected of a Japanese restaurant of this calibre.  Our server was a sweet elderly lady who enthusiastically explained and prepared each dish in Japanese. 

The meal itself was very traditional, but it was fantastic. Despite the simple preparation and cooking, these were the best clams I have had in my life. They were sweet, juicy and umami. Some of the clams we had were nearly a decade old and were half the size of my palm. These are clams that are harvest from the nearby river and Ise Bay.

We were served clams three-ways (boiled, grilled and tempura) together with side ingredients that were boiled in the clam hotpot stock. To finish off, our server made rice porridge which really hit the spot (there’s also an option for noodles). 

The restaurant is just a 30 min drive away from central Nagoya. While service was excellent, being able to speak simple Japanese is recommended. The staff do not speak English but will use devices to break through the language barrier. We had made the reservation through our hotel concierge about a few months in advance of our trip. Based on their website, it seems that in peak season (spring and early summer), reservations seem to be a lottery system and they are currently accepting applications for 2025 peak season. 

Score: 4.5/5. Cost was about 13600 yen per person, which was fair given the amount and quality of clams we ate. Z",finedining
1731567757.0,Experience with upselling and how to handle it,"I recently visited Cloudstreet, a two-star restaurant in Singapore. We began our meal with some snacks, and a staff member approached to ask if we’d like wine to accompany them. We politely declined, mentioning that we’d already chosen a non-alcoholic beverage pairing. The staff member then offered a non-alcoholic option to pair with the snacks. Assuming this was part of our tasting menu or included in the beverage pairing, we agreed. However, we later discovered we were charged $22 per glass for this drink—which contained barely two sips—and, to our surprise, it was already part of the beverage pairing. Essentially, we paid extra to try the same drink twice.

The main courses and desserts were excellent. But then, with the petit fours, the staff offered tea or coffee to go with them. Perhaps due to our inexperience, we assumed that, given the premium price of the tasting menu, tea or coffee would be included. Unfortunately, it wasn’t. We were charged $15 for a small, pre-steeped cup of tea that tasted like little more than hot water.

At no point did the staff inform us these items would incur additional charges, nor was it indicated on the menu.

While the food and service were otherwise outstanding, the subtle upselling left a sour note. 

I’m planning to visit another two-star restaurant in London, The Clove Club, and have read similar reviews about upselling there.

Would greatly appreciate hearing about similar experiences and any advice on handling these situations more effectively!

Thank you!

1731541737.0,"Hirokado (Beppu, Tabelog 4.41)","Had wonderful dinner at Hirokado in Beppu last month. To me, the restaurant is a complete package that ticks all the boxes:

- Produce: fervent supporter of local, organic provenance from Oita and Kyushu. Some were foraged or even caught by the staff.

- Cooking: Hirokado-san used to work at Ginza Shinohara, hence a lot of similarities in style and substance. However, flavour of dishes here is bolder and less restrained.

- Theme: an ode to the mountain and sea of Beppu. Our visit also coincided with the Tsukimi (Japanese harvest moon festival) hence some of the dishes came tagged with that storyline.

- Omotenashi: most fun and friendly restaurant crew. From the live produce showcase to tea ceremony to the guard of honour upon send-off.

- Cost performance: 24,000 yen which was excellent value given the cooking and ingredients. Very filling kaiseki meal.

- Reservation: Easy to moderate difficulty, via omakase.

Menu (Oct-24):

Soba tea: from buckwheat tea grown in Bungo-takada. Hand-roasted counter side to warm the stomach.

Sakizuke 1 (appetiser): Nokogiri Gazami mud crab caught in the local mangroves. Presented on a rabbit plate to resonate with moon harvest festival (Japanese believes in moon rabbit folklore).

Sakizuke 2 (appetiser): native chicken grilled over flame until medium rare. Juicy with zing from onions and ponzu.

Suimono: clam from Saiki in soothing dashi broth with yuzu. 

Sashimi 1: live Madai (red sea bream) butchered counter side and served 2 ways - thin, translucent slices and thicker slices which were lightly cooked.

Hassun (seasonal platter): plated to visualise the harvest moon festival, which is usually celebrated by watching the moon and eating mochi or dango. This was represented through a pyramid of mochi dumpling for praying while the rice grass illustrated abundant rice harvest.

Around 20 elements in the Hassun: mochi dumplings in 4 colours and flavour (egg, chestnut, seaweed, wild yam); White pumpkin cooked in dashi, shiitake, brown cheese, buckwheat cake, mullet roe, winter melon, venison, scallion, beets, stewed okra, stewed garlic chives buds, Misao soybeans

Yakimono 1 (grilled dish): Ayu sweet fish from Yamakuni river, brushed with tare made from the sweet fish as well. The head and bones were removed, fried until crunchy and served separately.

Yakinomo 2: grilled Matsutake, from Nagano, one of the few item procured outside Kyushu.

Yakimono 3: live Ise lobster butchered and grilled, red sea urchin, black abalone, piled on top of a puddle of lobster miso.

Nimono (simmered dish): flaky and fatty Longtooth grouper in fish bone stock.

Sunomono (palate cleanser): Steamed fig from Saga with Japanese honey & kobo vinegar. 

. Agemono (tempura):  freshwater shrimp caught by the sous chef, potato cooked in lobster broth, maitake mushroom and lotus, served piece by piece to ensure crispiness.

Yakimono 4: Domestic duck  raised using Aigamo farming method (live in paddy field). Slowly cooked for 3 hours on the bone to develop the flavour and juiciness.

Gohan: New ginkgo nut from Beppu with local Oita rice cooked in claypot. Lovely balance of sweetness and nuttiness.

Tamewan: soup  made from Fukashima miso and seafood stock.

Tsuemono: Pickled cucumber from 80-year aged rice bran.

Soba: freshly handmade in the morning using buckwheat flour form Hokkaido. Hirokado-dan trained at a famous soba restaurant in Hiroshima.

Dessert 1: Makuwa-uri Sherbet (oriental melon). Very refreshing.

Dessert 2: Baked Kudzu Pudding. Made from arrowroot, egg, and white bean paste. Starchy and not overly sweet which I enjoyed. mixed and cooked for 1 hour  before kneaded 

Tea: ceremonial matcha, whisked and made by taisho.

Omiyage: 6 onigiri. Surprisingly, the local guests didn’t receive (or maybe they refused)

Sake Pairing was priced at 6600 yen for around 10 types.

For a $1500 dinner, I should not be rushed out the door in an hour and 45 min. I was incredibly disappointed. The second we finished a course it was immediately switched for the next one. No pacing whatsoever? I felt more like a bother than a paying patron. When the servers gave the descriptions of the courses it literally felt like they were annoyed? I know this sounds pretentious but they also mixed up our utensils multiple times, and didn’t give a knife for a course that needed one. I thought that was strange for a 2*

1731503442.0,Madrid suggestions (Coque vs DiverXo)?,"Hello, I will be in Madrid in April of 2025 for 2 days and was hoping to get some suggestions and insight into fine dining restaurants. I’m going with my girlfriend and neither of us drinks very much; so regardless of the restaurant we choose we likely won’t do a pairing. We care more about the food and presentation/theatrics. We very rarely do fine dining so we like to experience something unique and different; both in terms of flavors and foods and theatrics and presentation. With this in mind it seems like DiverXo and Coque seem like the best fit; I was wondering if anyone has gone to both and if you have any strong points of comparison. Coque seems more theatrical so I’m wondering if the quality of the food takes a hit because of this. Coque is also more affordable. My budget for high end experiences during our 2 days in Madrid is around €1,000 for the both of us; DiverXo would pretty much consume the entire budget, whereas if we went to Coque we could potentially do one other high end experience on our other day in Madrid (I have been eyeing going to Corral de la Moreira to have some good food and experience some flamenco).

1731463549.0,"Ao Nishiazabu, Tokyo","This restaurant was a fantastic find, offering a unique take on French cuisine with strong Japanese influences. I booked through Tableall roughly two weeks in advance, opting for the 17:00 slot with the wine pairing, which came to a total of 112,000 JPY.  For those who prefer to skip the wine pairing, Omakase.in also offers reservations without the mandatory wine pairing at a more wallet-friendly price of 55,000 JPY per person, but be prepared to book well in advance (think two months or more).
 
Finding the restaurant itself presented a bit of an adventure. Nestled in an unassuming building with a discreet entrance on the second floor via a spiral staircase, it's easy to miss the signage. For First-timers, allow yourself some extra time to locate it.
 
The meal itself was truly fascinating. Every course was well above average (that’s already very good for me), with some genuine standouts like the shrimp sauce with bread (pic 5) and the bamboo sided to the wagyu (pic 10). The wine pairing complemented the flavors beautifully, and each wine was enjoyable even on its own. My only critique would be the pace of service. The 14-course meal flew by in less than two hours, feeling a bit rushed, especially with the addition of the wine pairings. This wouldn't necessarily be a dealbreaker for everyone, but if you prefer a more leisurely dining experience, I'd recommend opting for the later 20:00 slot or skipping the pairing.
 
Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who appreciate French cuisine with a distinct Japanese twist.

1731448508.0,The Wolf's Tailor (*) - Denver,"I had the tasting menu at The Wolf's Tailor (A hyper seasonal and locally sourced menu) this past weekend in a party of 2. Did not do the beverage pairing because neither of us were trying to drink that much (alcohol or otherwise) but the variety of cocktails, beer, wine, and other drinks did sound really intriguing. Went with a non-a ginger beer that was great. 

This was my first 1 star restaurant in my sort of backwards journey through starred tasting menus having previously visited Benu (***) and Saison (**) earlier this year. While the star ranking difference is clear and well justified between these, I really thoroughly enjoyed the experience at The Wolf's Tailor. And while the service at both of those restaurants were ""better,"" within the context of being in Denver, I don't think the experience would have been improved had the service been like it was at either of those places. The one thing that did feel like it could be improved was the communication regarding the courses. There were a lot of really unique ingredients whose origins and seasonality were well explained, but not as much on what they taste like or what to expect. 

In terms of flavor, everything tasted great but outside of one dish nothing felt ""incredibly delicious"" like the other mentioned restaurants did. Many of the dishes did wow me on the combination of flavors though (that green tomato lemon grass dessert was executed so well). Also important to add, I've spent the last several months on a very strict diet so my palate wasn't necessarily in the best state to appreciate this meal.  Even though most everything tasted just a bit too salty to me, it was definitely a personal thing. 

The dish that tasted the most delicious to me was the small panna cotta bite in the beginning. Both of the cold desserts were also really enjoyable. The bison dish was a little unfortunate with great flavors but really tough even considering how lean the meat is. 

All that said do hope I get the opportunity to visit this place again and try some of the other places in Denver.",finedining

Anyways, the restaurant was very enjoyable, but up until now my 'Michelin' experience had always been more traditional tasting menus and fine dining, and it got me thinking...

Both my girlfriend and I thought each dish was a banger.  Each was fairly balanced in flavor, acidicity, and the perfect bite/portion. The homemade salsa verde was fantastic.

Rania is an elevated Indian restaurant in DC.  We dined here a year ago and loved it so came back.  They added a tasting menu about a month ago so we ordered it along with a bottle of wine.  They have an excellent cocktail menu however I feel their wine menu is lacking and a bit overpriced.  The staff were nice and fun. The meal lasted about 2h 45m.  I enjoyed the tasting menu versus the pick your own courses style.  

1. Laccha Aloo Chaat, white pea ragda, sorrel chutney - The crispy laccha aloo added the perfect crunch, while the white pea ragda was smooth and comforting. The sorrel chutney had a zing that lifted everything, balancing all those rich flavors with a bright, tangy kick. Each bite had so much going on, yet it all came together beautifully.

2. Diver scallops, Mangalorean curry, grilled fennel - The scallops were tender, with a subtle sweetness that gelled with the Mangalorean curry’s warmth and spices. The grilled fennel added a nice smoky layer, which grounded the whole dish. It was an exciting combination of delicate and bold flavors that worked in harmony.

3. Nargisi Kofta, quail egg, swiss chard, truffle cream, pickled mushrooms - The kofta was soft and flavorful, and when I cut into it, the perfectly cooked quail egg inside was such a treat. The truffle cream was rich without being too heavy, and those pickled mushrooms gave a great tangy contrast.

4. Pasta stuffed with Lobster in a yellow cream sauce and caviar - The pasta was delicate, filled with succulent lobster, and the yellow cream sauce was rich but somehow not overpowering—it let the lobster really shine. The little pop of caviar added just the right amount of saltiness.

5. Lamb Cheela, red onion laccha, buttermilk mousse - The lamb cheela was incredibly flavorful, with spices that lingered pleasantly on the palate. The red onion laccha added crunch and a bit of sharpness that balanced the lamb, while the buttermilk mousse brought in a smooth, tangy element that tied everything together. It was a perfect mix of textures and flavors.

6. Anise flavored sorbet palette cleanser - The anise flavor was subtle but distinctive, leaving a cool, clean feeling that reset my taste buds for the next course. Light and refreshing.

7. Hay-aged Pork Loin Vindaloo, crispy pork belly, charred spring onion - The pork loin was tender with a smoky hint from the hay aging, and the vindaloo sauce brought a lovely heat. The crispy pork belly was indulgent and added a great texture. The charred spring onion gave a slight bitterness that cut through the richness of the dish.

8. Apple pie and cinnamon-spiced ice cream - Warm, with perfectly tender apples and a buttery, flaky crust. The cinnamon-spiced ice cream had just the right amount of spice. I’m not a fan of apple desserts, but this was excellent.",finedining

L'Abysse \*\*: Weekday lunch.  They have a new chef these days and the chirashi bowl is no longer on the menu.  Instead, it's replaced by three thin slices of tuna with some rice that was terribly undercooked.  Left hungry despite extra orders of nigiri and sashimi. Overall not worth the cost of the meal.  

Guy Savoy \*\*: Weekday lunch.  Solid service, decent meals.  Scallop appetizer cooked two ways was perfection. The artichoke soup is still a highlight.  I thought the chicken was a little dry, but still had good flavors. Pear dessert was excellent.  Pretty much as expected, overall. 

Pavillon Ledoyen \*\*\*: Weekday dinner.  Overall not bad.  Some dishes were excellent (salad, Wagyu). but some were misses.  We both had a dish dish; mine was nearly raw while my mom's was overcooked.   The white truffle/cheese course at 75Euro a serving was definitely not worth it.  The nonalcoholic pairing was very interesting.  Overall, it wasn't bad, but certainly felt very average. 

Arpege \*\*\*: Weekday lunch.  Incredible.  Sometimes I forget that vegetables can be delicious, but this reminded me to eat my greens and all the things that grow in the garden.  The cabbage/beet thing that looked like a brain was one of the best things I ate on this entire trip.  We had a clear vegetable soup with an incredible depth of flavor.  The veal and the tarte tatin were also excellent.  

Le Gabriel \*\*\*: Weekday lunch.  Got the periple menu.  Excellent cooking techniques with perfect balance of flavors and textures.  Squid noodles were a little greasy, but very indulgent.  Desserts also exellent.  Service was good and the pace was comfortable.  Best chicken and oyster of the trip.  Excellent. 

Kei \*\*\*: Weekend lunch.  Ended up with a mish-mash of the menus as I wanted the wild duck and the truffles.  The sauce for the duck is a true masterpiece.  The white truffle risotto was worth the hefty price.  Caviar and tuna course here was excellent.  Always a favorite restaurant and I am unabashedly obsessed with their bread and olive oil.  

Plenitude \*\*\*: Excellent cooking, very good attention to detail and it's hard to beat dinner overlooking the river.  However, the first courses were very very rushed to get everyone into the kitchen and out again.  We had maybe give minutes to sit and eat before they came to get us.  Wine pairings were top notch.  They probably have the most comfortable dining chairs I've ever sat in and the bread was excellent. My probably unpopular opinion is that the food was lost in the theme.  I don't need a sauce to tie every thing together; sometimes I just want a good plate of food.  Thankfully, not worth the hassel of reservations in the future. 

Epicure \*\*\*: Utterly disappointing dinner.  Left prior to finishing dinner.  I posted a review going in depth. 

Le Pre Catelan \*\*\*: Weekday dinner.  We had been here previously and had a great time, so decided to come back.  Mom wasn't feeling well, so she had the shorter menu and I had the longer and ate half her food in addition.  This was solid, classic French food with not a single misstep.  Service was warm, welcoming and made me feel incredibly relaxed despite the setting.  I remember feeling excited for each upcoing course.  Probably impressive considering I ate a heck of a lot of food that night.  Langoustine, caviar on champagne, and a funny looking tuna slice were my favorites.  

Hakuba: Dinner. Incredible meal.  Impeccable ingredients, intricate preparations, beautiful setting.  We did get to see the different chefs rotate through, which was a lot of fun.  We reserved the first seating which was rather rushed as I think the chefs had to get to the other two tables.  Dessert was perhaps the weakest part of the meal for me, but still very good.  A bit pricey, but still worth it. 

Montee: a tiny restaurant near Montparnasse.  No stars, just precise, beautiful cooking by a Japanese chef.  This will forever be on my reservation list.  ",finedining

We don't have a preference for a tasting menu versus a la carte, or the kind of cuisine that is served as long as the food is up to standards (and within our budget of around $100-$150 pp). Dirt Candy seems pretty unique considering it is a vegetarian tasting menu, and Four Horsemen seems like a more casual vibe, which is fine. 63 Clinton seems like a great value but I've read mixed reviews on some of the courses.

Has anyone been to any of these three recently?

Thank you in advance.",finedining
1731263314.0,"佐たけ | Sushi Satake, Tokyo, Japan","Sushi Satake offers a nigiri-only lunch option (no otsumami) on Wednesday and Saturdays for a reduced price of ¥16,000. Decided to try it based on a YT channel I’m subscribed to, and if all went well, do a return visit for their dinner menu (otsumami looked promising).

Sushi Satake likes to serve shari at different temperatures, was mentioned while serving one of the customers. Speaking frankly though, by the time nigiri was served to us (seated 2nd last), shari probably cooled down already (not prepared individually).

**Experience**:

Be on time. Meal is same time start. Diners next to us were ~10m late, chef may deny you entry/ skip courses. There was an unwelcome/ hostile attitude towards the late diners, e.g. they asked for wine list, waiter a) ignored b) pretended no wine list c) chef 'slammed' their first few nigiri vs gently serving ours lol.

Also, chef seemed quite 'demanding'. There were 2 solo diners, one was taking pictures as his pieces were served on the counter, took not longer than 10-15s each time. Chef suggested to eat immediately, mentioned there are different types of diners, people who are here for the sushi (eat immediately) vs people here to take photos, etc. Solo dining can already be an intimidating experience, would hate to be told what I should/ shouldn't do. Would understand if he said this to the late diners (they had 3 nigiris chilling on the counter at one point). Guessing chef was kinda fed up.

**Food**:

\++nodoguro, buttery, oily, melt in your mouth

\-ikura, my usual criticism for ikura is some places make it too salty; this time, it was on the bland side. As the photo shows, color is also on the lighter side. Maybe I'm missing something...

\~kasugo, first time, seemed similar to tai/ madai

\~hirame, not the biggest fan as IME can be chewy and bland tasting (unless aburi or the skirt/ collar). However, adding shiso (?) (not sure what leaf was used) helped accentuate the hirame

Admittedly, was dissappointed no akami or kurumaebi. Meal was not really filling. You are allowed add ons, but since nothing really stood out, I decided not to. 

**Recommendations**?

So far, have been to Sushi Satake, Gahojin (Fukuoka), Sushi Labo, Tokami (Hong Kong). Feels like c/p hasn been quite low, other than Sushi Labo. Planning to mix it up next time by trying Sushidokoro Kiraku and Sushi Keita for shellfish focus. Othrerwise, ready to give up on sushi and focus on kaiseki. But before I do, anyone have recommendations in Tokyo/ Fukuoka for ¥40,000>?

1731259418.0,Odette (***) Singapore ,"Amuse bouche - the bottom one tasted like a cruller, shrimp taco on the right, and some type of tart (tasted like a tart filled with milk). Overall, nothing special.

2nd pic - their mushroom “tea”. Similar to mushroom stock and very rich in mushroom flavor. As a mushroom lover, I really enjoyed this. The bread with the shaved mushroom was alright.

3rd pic - bread and butter. The sliced bread on the right was hard and stale. The cruffin on the left was alright. Butter was alright. Overall disappointed and turned down seconds. 

4th pic - uni on top of crispy prawn. The prawn wasn’t crispy and tasted greasy. I love uni, but this was disappointing. 

5th  pic - caviar on a mussel cloud. Not sure what the mussel cloud is. Essentially just tasted like caviar on some heavy whipping cream. 

6th pic - scallop crudo with a horse radish sauce garnished with dill. Not bad but not memorable.

7th pic - rosemary smoked egg. I don’t understand the concept of this dish. It was overshadowed by its gimmicky dry ice show. It was so unmemorable, I can’t even describe it. 

8th pic - abalone with foie gras topped with pork broth. Im typically not a foie gras person due to its overpowering gameyness, but this one wasnt overpowering. The Abalone was tender. One of the stars of the night. 

9th - blue lobster with beurre blac. Lobster was cooked to perfection. The problem I had with this dish was the sauce. It was very sweet for some reason, like butter cooked with brown sugar. 

10th- their signature pigeon cooked medium rare. Pretty much a gamey bird similar to duck. Reminds me of Cantonese roasted squab in terms of flavor. 

11 - passion fruit sorbet on top of sobacha (closest thing I can compare this to is granola). One of the stars of the night.

12 -deconstructed tiramisu. 

13 - more desserts. Bottom is a marshmallow dusted with matcha - didn’t care for this. Right - fruits imported from Japan. I’ve been to Japan and had some of their top tier designer fruits, and this was not it. Tasted just like any ordinary fruit you can get on the shelf at your average grocery store. Forgot the name of the top pastry, but it was difficult to chew and tasted burnt. Left - another milked filled tart. Didn’t care for any of these. 

Price was about 450 USD. Service was great. The food came out in a timely manner. Water was always topped off. Odette was very middle of the pack for me. I rate it a 6/10. ",finedining

1731234895.0,"Septime (*), Paris - underwhelming","
I recently got some great suggestions from this sub for my trip to London and Paris. I plan to do a write up of the full trip, but wanted to do separate posts for a few standouts and/or places that haven’t had a detailed review lately. I was very excited for dinner at Septime, my first tasting in Paris, and am sorry to report it was pretty underwhelming. 

The food wasn’t bad by any means. Every dish had something about it I liked, and a couple of them I liked a lot. But most of the dishes fell short of that satisfying hit of a good dish, let alone the “wow” of a great one. Some of the dishes were incredibly salty, the sauces in particular, which I know was meant to add flavor to less flavorful ingredients, but that doesn’t result in a balanced dish if the flavor isn’t there by other means, especially if composing anything less than the perfect bite results in an unpleasant mouthful. 

But my biggest issue was with the progression of the meal. I’m always glad to have small courses and more veg during a tasting, but the meal didn’t feel substantial enough, not just in amount of food, but in terms of bringing enough flavor and satisfaction to the table. There were three veg courses that felt like each could have been a light little throwaway course to help transition between canapés and more substantive courses; that’s too many, out of seven, of which two are dessert. I have no problem with this many veg dishes per se, but I couldn’t help comparing them unfavorably to a ceps and celery small plate I’d had at Frenchie Bar à Vins the night before, which I thought was tastier and more interesting than any of the seven dishes I had at Septime. I have a relatively small appetite, and this is the first time in my life I have ever left a tasting contemplating going out for a second dinner; the only reason I didn’t was because I had another reservation the next night (at Amâlia, which was so much better that it assured me my experience at Septime was not just my taste being off). 

The service was fine but left me a bit cold, particularly compared to the meals I had later in Paris (Amâlia, Alliance, Le Rigmarole). I should note I was a solo diner, and the tables around me did seem to get more attention and a warmer service. If I were to go again, I would probably just got for one of the walk in bar seats instead of getting a reservation. 

What I ate:

Cabbage broth with brown butter (not pictured): tasty, too salty but forgivable to me because of the depth of flavor (which I didn’t find to be the case with subsequent dishes)

Bread sticks with kimchi salt: fine, but it was hard to get the sauce to stick to the breadstick

Scallops from Normandie, cured with kombu, juice of heritage squash, fig leaf oil, sage, gooseberry, carrot: tasty, fun, interesting 

Mushroom veloute with whole mushrooms, pine sabayon, walnut oil: fine but the velouté itself was too salty; it was good in small amounts with the mushrooms and bread, but difficult to eat otherwise

Celeriac, seaweed butter, grape: another dish that was fine; first bite was too salty, second bite was underseasoned, more pleasant afterwards; the most interesting and tasty of the three veg dishes, but I would have appreciated it more if not served after the velouté

Cauliflower, dehydrated caper leaves, lemongrass: if I hadn’t been keeping count, I would have been shocked for this to be the second to last savory course; the most underwhelming of the three vegetable courses, not unpleasant to eat by any means, but it’s just a piece of cauliflower that really hasn’t been transformed or elevated in any way; I’ve had cauliflower as tasty or better as a side at many a garden variety casual restaurant 

Roasted pigeon, anchovy, fermented plum sauce; on the side, tostada with pigeon ragout: my favorite dish of the night, perfectly cooked and very tasty, though still, nothing more interesting than a well-executed protein with a nice sauce; the tostada was a welcome addition since I was really craving more substantial bites 

Clementine, fermented red fruits, verbena oil: a pleasant predessert palate cleanser, like an elevated fruit salad

Chocolate sorbet, smoked paprika oil (sorry, took a bite before I remembered to take a photo): I’m admittedly not a fan of chocolate sorbet, so hard to assess this usefully, but I would have expected something a little more here, as this felt like a step down from the predessert

Vanilla cake petit four (not pictured): this was nice, I would have taken two or three of these instead of both desserts ",finedining
1731210716.0,Alcalde in GDL - curious for thoughts ,"I’m in Guadalajara for a few weeks and I like to do a tasting menu every now and then. After doing some research and asking the community it came down to this or Xocol, but Alcalde’s reservations worked out better with my schedule.

It was…not good. For the record, I don’t blame this community at all - it’s possible I was there on an off day.

My gripes: 
1. There was no menu. Yes, I understand tasting menus can change day by day. But seriously no printed menu that I can reference there or afterwards? Even the menu online is outdated (almost a year ago). No cocktail menu (I was told by my server “I am the menu”)
2. The upcharge for caviar was egregious. It’s like $700 MXN extra and my server pushed it on me like a drug dealer. Like “the dish is not meant to be eaten without it” type of shit
3. Wine pairings were irregular and sparse (eg one wine across multiple courses) and not particularly congruent
4. Service was great in the beginning when they were selling me things and then immediately dropped off. 

All of this would be somewhat excusable if the food had been mind-blowing. Not a single dish was. They ranged from mediocre to good (oh, and the dish that “absolutely needed caviar”)? No, it did not. 

Photos attached, can’t tell you what anything is. And I paid handily for this FYI",finedining

1731186203.0,"The Ledbury (***) - London, England","London's newest 3-Michelin star is not new by any means. Opening in 2005, The Ledbury had been a fixture on the London fine dining scene for the better part of 15 years, until covid put a dead stop to it in 2020. Chef-patron Brett Graham took the two-year hiatus as an opportunity for reinvention. Gone were the white walls, and in their place a more modern update, something perhaps more complimentary to some of the best plating to be found in the English capital; statuesque mushrooms encased in glass cabinets give a nod towards the fungi being grown in the basement of the restaurant (and which guests will find on their plates), while the dark wood and curved centerpiece table provide suitable surrounds for the impeccable game presented in the middle of the meal.

Service at The Ledbury is exceptional, with the wait staff quick with smiles and very happy to engage in discourse. While a 3-star, there is very little air of stuffiness to proceedings at The Ledbury. All of these initial impressions are excellent, but what of the food? Everything is plated with finesse, the dishes are clearly well thought out, but I feel that few of the dishes really packed enough of a punch (either through creative invention or flavour) to live long in the memory. Case in point: the turbot dish had wonderful pop from the gooseberries when they would happen upon the fork/spoon, but otherwise the sauce was left to do the heavy lifting, and each seemed to be good but not the flavour sensation that it should have been. This is where preference comes into play: I enjoy intense flavours, though that doesn't mean that everything has to be punchy. If the aim is for a delicate dish, it should be oh-so. This was the case with my favourite dish of the evening, the quail, which did a great job of awakening the taste buds after a palette cleansing opening act. But after the quail, the menu didn't seem to crescendo. It was pretty happy to be andantino (andante would be unnecessarily harsh). 

The cooking at The Ledbury is excellent. Perfect deer, perfect scallop, perfect pastry (the laminated swirl with roscoff onion and caerphilly cheese is a delight, every layer clearly visible when you bite into it). There is no question as to the technical excellence on display. What I would have liked to see more of, is more invention, more dishes that make me stop and go 'oh wow' before I begin eating. Some had me nodding my head, but none - sadly - bestowed a eureka moment.

1731149682.0,Albatross Death Cult - Birmingham (UK),"don't normally write reviews, but as a somewhat regular fine diner, this is the best restaurant I've eaten in all year, and I've seen relatively little hype for it. No photos because I don't do photos, I'm sure you can find some on Google if this piques your interest.

Albatross Death Cult (you will either love this name or think it's very stupid, I love it) is a side venture to the well established Wilderness (also in Birmingham), and opened earlier this year. It has a single counter that sits about 16, and a seafood-heavy menu that draws from both asian and french cuisine. As with the parent restaurant, it's pleasingly informal - post-punk music playing, enjoyably relaxed atmosphere, no stuffiness. If you like more traditional service, this is not going to be one for you.
 
what stood out more than anything was how well they handled bold flavours, letting some really big punchy flavours come through while maintaining complexity, and avoiding one flavour overwhelming the dish. Oh, and the saucing, my god the saucing was good (and highly varied), I scraped the bowl on every course.

the snacks at the start set the tone - a  poached oyster in a light dressing, followed by a trio of crunchy containers for three different combinations of raw fish, something creamy and something acidic - each was perfectly executed, and had something to give it a bit of complexity while still being a lovely coherent single bite

the dish of the night for me was a dish of smoked mussels in a veloute of (amongst other things) the cooking liquor, a little chilli, some lime, and lots of peppercorns. The saucing was impeccable all night, but this one in particular had so much depth and balance, the peppercorns were the primary flavour and could so easily have dominated but they let everything else come through to create a really complex flavour which absolutely blew me away

other dishes that I greatly enjoyed included a crab dish (picked white crab, a brown crab custard, and little 'pearls' of apple that all combined into a textural delight), hamachi in a sesame beurre noisette (gloriously rich), and a steamed scallop with miso butter

the dessert was a riff on a sushi roll, with ice cream made from sushi rice served with shiitake caramel and candied nori, a nice little concept well executed, and a lovely complement to the rest of the meal

even the one or two courses that didn't 100% hit for me were very good. For example, chu-toro on a rice flour croquette was meant to be a play on nigiri but I felt that the relative heaviness of the croquette (as compared to sushi rice) stopped the tuna from truly shining. But, let's be honest, it was still delicious, I just think that this was one case where the traditional way still wins for me.

and as one other very minor point, I would have loved a bread course, both because I'm a little bread slut, but also because it would have been perfect to mop up those beautiful sauces (assuming I don't get overexcited and eat all the bread within 5 minutes of it arriving). But given how many impeccable courses there were for the price, I certainly don't feel short-changed, and it feels a bit unfair even writing this, I just really love bread

price-wise a menu of 5-6 'snacks', 5-6 larger courses, one dessert and petit-fours is currently £99. I did their pairing (4 sakes, 2 wines, I enjoyed them all), plus a couple of other drinks, and got out for under £200/head after the service charge. For the quality of cooking, and a three hour experience, that's incredible value. I suspect it's not sustainable in the long run given they can only fit in 16 covers a night, so don't be surprised if the price is somewhat higher in a year - it'll still be worth it

overall, this was my best meal of 2024, and it's not even very close. My best meal of 2023 was Aulis in London, which was almost twice as expensive, and if you put a gun to my head I'm not sure which I'd prefer, this really feels like a special restaurant",finedining

1731116951.0,KOKE - Kyoto (*) REVIEW,"Honestly…… wtf 

Coming from Melbourne Australia where we are spoilt with food in terms of multicultural cuisine and fusion I thought Koke was one of the most underwhelming meals I have ever had. I have dined at a few fine dining establishments overseas (both non and Michelin recommended or awarded) and found the price and overall cohesiveness of the menu and customer service to be disappointing. 

Am I crazy? Most dishes were overly salty or had absolutely no flavour at all (such as they did not add any value to other components to the dish or the overall course or was extremely overwhelming and did not balance the flavours of the main dish). I will give credit to the main(s) as the venison was cooked to perfection and one of the best venison I’ve ever had in my life but it was paired with a fermented sake sauce with whole peppercorns. Making the dish overly salty and peppery which really overpowered the natural taste of venison making the whole dish less enjoyable overall. 

At one point another diner with us could not even finish their salad (winter melon course) in which the server proceeded to ask them if they would like to reduce the remaining courses, at this point we had only covered 25% of the menu. I’m sorry as a dinner are we not entitled to not clear the plate or finish certain dishes due to preference or distaste in flavours and foods? And also as a paying customers I think it was abit presumptuous to assume the lack of clearing dishes especially that early into dinner was due to being full. Parts of the service was very awkward especially when serving the rice soup the waiter had asked abruptly how many servings we wanted without actually running through the dish, or did not show us what the portions were or what the dish even was? I didn’t even know it was a soupy rice dish until I had to ask myself what they were serving to provide an answer for serving size. 

Honestly if all the dishes were average I wouldn’t have been so critical and harsh in my overall thoughts of the restaurant however the dishes were really on either side of the spectrum and really nothing in between. Overall will probably not dine here again seeing as the menu does not change that much with some seasonal ingredients change. Just as an FYI price per person was around $320AUD which included a bottle of wine amongst 4 people.

1731072054.0,"Knystaforsen (1* + Green Star) in Rydöbruk, Sweden","I posted a few weeks ago about opinions on this restaurant and I just wanted to thank the community for not leading me astray. This restaurant is truly a masterclass in unique concept + truly good food done right.

Located in a very remote village, inside of an old saw mill in rural Sweden, their main ""gimmick"" is that all of their dishes have some element of being cooked over fire. I put ""gimmick"" in parentheses, because it's way more than that. Every dish we had was truly balanced and creative in its use of of these burnt, smoky, fried flavors. One of my partners thought that this would overwhelm him, as he usually doesn't enjoy smoky tastes, but he said that it opened his eyes. It was truly astounding how versatile the effects of fire on each individual dish was.

Furthermore, while it's very often so that one star restaurants have that one dish that isn't quite so perfect, I didn not find that to be the case with Knystaforsen. Every dish was inspired and memorable for me and I will truly be looking back at this meal very fondly.

A few hightlights. I won't talk about all the dishes because there was a lot:
- The burnt leek dish with whey sauce and pike roe. Truly amazing how beautiful this tasted. I also recommend the non-alc pairing from the bottom of my heart because it made the dish sing.
- The amuse was already amazing off the bat. Perfectly cooked chantrelles on this tree with smoked cheese, moose tartar and pike perch on dried lingonberries
- This miraculous burnt onion. I won't elaborate as I really don't want to spoil it for you.
- We ordered the extra cheese course because we truly didn't want the experience to end. And this was such a great idea. All cheeses are made less than 20km from the restaurant and the depth in flavor of all of them was astounding.
- The casual, but attentive service that truly made us all feel at home.

1731065311.0,AM par Alexandre Mazzia (***),"Wonderful Lunch at AM Par (\*\*\*). Was Rather full from breakfast so opted for the 2 Course 135€ option and supplement of Caviar (which turned out to be 3 show stopping dishes) and got served 31+3 dishes overall

Great to see the chefs working in the open kitchen, and Chef Alexandre made it a point to walk around and greet every table before he left.

Many Japanese ingredients and touches despite no apparent Japanese experiences in his CV

  
Stand outs:

pic 4 grey shrimps, katsuboshi, green chilli oil -

pic 9 oyster-shell infused chicken broth was absolutely delicious.

pic 10 caviar presented 3 ways. 

Would highly recommend for great value , portions and creativity

I have dinner reservations at Pierre Gagnaire next week and have a question about the tasting menu vs. a la carte. 

My husband and I have lots of experience with Michelin dining and he very much prefers tasting menus. But I've seen numerous people here (and elsewhere) say that a la carte is the way to go at PG because it better embodies PG's concept, but I've had difficulty finding a description of what exactly is so different between the menu and a la carte: is it that a la carte employs more of the ""satellite"" experience and that the tasting menu is simply more of a straightforward-style of presentation? -- Thanks!",finedining
1731009649.0,Torrisi (1*) NYC,"Overall a really fun experience. We had a huge miscommunication between the service team, which I hear is extremely rare. Our table’s orders were mixed up with another table’s orders. When I ordered the zeppole they said they ran out but gave it to us. The table which they mixed us up with didn’t mind giving the dish to us as they were locals, we had a good laugh. But somehow they were given the zeppole as well. I actually had a conversation about our experience with our server at Cote and he said that he’s never heard of anything of this sort at Torrisi. The food however was phenomenal.

The bread was super seedy and the herbed butter complimented it very well. My cucumber drink was super tasty. The American Hams with Zeppole lived up to the hype. The pineapple jam made for a sweet/salty combo that was to die for. The Porchetta Hero was fucking beautiful. The spicy wasabi worked really well with the crispy, fatty, rich porchetta. The Tortellini Pomodoro and the Cavatelli with Jamaican Beef Ragu were both divine. The pasta is thin and supple but still retained a very satisfying bite. I actually liked the Cavatelli more, the rich and spicy saucy was divine. The Tortellini Pomodoro was excellent, simple but very well executed. The Chicken Alla Griglia was cooked beautifully, the skin was crisp like a caramel brittle. The chicken itself was extremely juicy, however my one complaint was that the chicken was so salty. However, the juicyness and cook made me keep eating it. The complementary sorbets were a nice touch.  The Almond Cheesecake was rich and sweet, the nutty almond flavor with the tart cherry compote contrasted to make a very well balanced dessert. The Affogato was creamy, sweet, with a strong coffee flavor from the decaf, we really enjoyed the affogato. 

Torrisi is a wonderful restaurant and I wish to come back when I can. I can see why the whole day was booked out within thirty seconds.",finedining

This place was an experience. My first two star and I can really tell the difference between this and a one star. I had such high expectations after Albi and I had a great time here. The service was pretty perfect. The drink pairing was interesting, I liked it. The starting bites were really good. The mains were very good as well but I feel like the meat courses could’ve been more wowing. They were just perfectly cooked meats with a sauce. Idk maybe I just expected to have my pants blown off 💀. I mean overall the savory courses were still great. The desserts however were insane. The white peach courses had me on the edge of my seat and my pre diabetic cousin was feeling himself so much I almost wanted to leave. The smoked charcoal dessert course was so so smoky and sweet. The magic box really felt magical. The staff was so lovely. The take home menu and matcha lattes were packaged so beautifully. The matcha lattes were so fucking buss 👅👅👅. Overall though I probably wouldn’t go again unless they are awarded their third star or if I get rich 💀. Albi would def be a place I’d go to for special occasions.

They served the Tortellini as their last dish, which was interesting approach, when we were plenty full.

She enjoys a wide range of food levels, thank god lol.  She enjoys cheap hole in the wall places all the way to fine dining. 

I have a much smaller range of price for food I’m happy with. 

Just to make you laugh and roll your eyes at me… I consider fine dining anything greater than like $30-40 per plate. I grew up on the other side of the tracks… poorish. I’ve gone to college then grad school. I’ve done “okay”. My partner and I both make middish 100-200K but ya. I enjoy fast food, hole in the wall places, and non fine dining restaurants. I hate cooking. I hate being pampered (I don’t even like my hair being washed at a salon). I don’t care about history really or alcohol (but I drink it!). 

I can’t taste the difference between fine dining and regular dining. The portions are so small I usually want to stop at a fast food place later lol. In fact, usually I think fine dining food taste worse than cheap food. I don’t have the pallet for it. Recently I had a $50 Red snapper and it reminded of oven baked fish sticks growing up. I never know any of the ingredients on the food menu or the alcohol menu. 

I don’t mind spending money on experiences, but fine dining is not an experience to me. Traveling to exotic places, scuba diving, jet skiing, jumping out of an airplane, private tours, private classes to learn some art/sport, going to a nice concert or event, etc are things I’d splurge on. 

In fact, it makes my skin crawl being in a fine dining environment. I just didn’t grow up that way and I have negative feelings towards it. 

I really like my partner a lot and I’m trying to change. I don’t want to ruin her experience by being a sour piece of shit. She even said it’s totally fine (because she’s awesome) but I want to be there with her on her foodie journey. I’ve done a lot of reading online about it. I’m trying hard to change my mindset it’s just ingrained in me. I feel like I almost get anxiety when I’m in a fine dining restaurant. Like I don’t belong.  

I’m just wondering if anyone had feelings like mine and they changed over time. You can be brutally honest with me and call me out on my shit lol. ",finedining

Only 18 seats too quick felt very intimate. 

Didn’t take a photo of every course but we rated them and none were below a 7/10 

Really loved the service and it wasn’t too formal. The chefs had banter with each other and would come round to show ingredients and get the guests to try things as they were preparing it. 

It was v pricey (£550 each for dinner, wine paring and some cocktails before), but ultimately worth it for a 5hr amazing experience. 

I’ve eaten at many Michelin star restaurants including multiple 2 and 3 star and this topped the lot.  ",finedining
1730818888.0,ISO French tasting menu NYC. ,"A friend of mine has never done fine dining and I wanted to take her.   She wanted to try French food. I move tasting menus. Here we are.  

Money isn’t that big of an issue but I’d like to keep it under $250 a person. (Neither of us drink so we really are looking at just the food price) Of course I’d rather spend $350 than waste $250 so I don’t want to “settle”. 

Ideally Manhattan west side, but anywhere on the island is fine. No Brooklyn. 

Any tips? ",finedining
1730810379.0,Are restaurants getting too cute with their plates and utensils?,"Honest question. Was recently at a very lovely michelin starred restaurant. The food was of course delicious, but at some point their plates, bowls, utensils, and such starred to bug me. Every piece was a unique, hand-made work of art. Varying materials, sizes, shapes. Some had stories. Some made sense, like serving uni in the shell of a sea urchin. Some were awkward as heck. 

I get that, like Alchemist, plating and presentation can be part of the experience, but does anyone think its gotten out of hand? Do restaurants not own 6, 8, 10, 12 inch round-ish plates and bowls?",finedining

1730764381.0,"Mesa de Lemos (* and green *), Portugal","An unforgettable experience in rural Portugal, in an almost The Menu-esque setting (in the middle of a beautiful vineyard). I made a reservation via email. It's a relatively traditional menu layout, with 6 and 8 course options at 120 and 150 euros, with reasonable wine pairings available. We went with the 8 course, but in hindsight definitely should've gone with the 6 due to the sheer amount of food. 

My overall experience was definitely positive. A few really good bites, and overall very impressive cooking and presentation, all in a very unique and cool environment. Service was solid and professional. I think that it's a pretty great value compared to anything similar in other countries, and would say that 1 star is the correct evaluation. However, I will say that I was hopeful for overall better flavors. Most bites fell in the good to very good range, with really only the first bite being exceptional for me. Presentation was impressive, but as you can see from the pictures not 100% precise the way some places achieve. So while it was still a great time, I won't really remember many specific flavors as I might as some of my all time favorite meals.

The beginning bite, even before seeing a menu, was the pine nut ice cream. For me this was actually the highlight of the whole night--it was perfectly balanced with it's sweetness, salt, and herbs. Excellent flavors, and worked really well as a first bite. I'll remember this one for a while to come. 

There were several more small bites before starting the menu. The course of pea-based dishes was impressive, with some good bites standing out. The same was true of the second, beet-based course. The horse mackerel I was unfortunately not a fan of. Finally, we got some bread, olive oil, and butter which also was not notable.

The menu began with the smoked eel asparagus. I always love smoked things so enoyed it, though the asparagus was stringy and difficult to cut. 

The sea bream was next, and was my favorite of the fish dishes. Nicely cooked, gentle flavor with a nice bread to go with the sauce. 

Cod came next (very popular and important in Portugal) with a codfish belly salad. The fish was very smooth but not the best flavor, and the salad was interesting but way overpowered by vinegar and broccoli. 

The John Dory course was pretty good, but there was nothing notable besides the fish itself which is a decently mild flavor.

The lamb and lamb tartare were quite good. The salad and carrot peanut butter thing were super weird and out of place, however. 

Palette cleanser kiwi/celery sorbet with a ""cottage cheese"" was very refreshing and did its job well. Great course, one of my favorites. 

""Apple pie"" dessert was also quite solid and fun. Essentially apple, cinnamon, white chocolate, ice cream. Hard to miss. 

Pineapple dessert was not very noteworthy. Kinda hurt to eat the sugar crystal barbed wire lol. 

Finally, the chocolates (also sold in boxes by the restaurant) were pretty ambitious flavor combos, and not all my cup of tea. I liked the 7 spices one the most. ",finedining

Do you guys have any recommendation that is as good as Gymkhana or Trishna? I can say my standard for Indian food is not so high as I really enjoyed Dishoom everytime I went.  
  
On a side note, I'd love to hear your recommendations on a good pasta place (I'm thinking of going to Luca), or French dining (preferably classic style). I thought of going to the Ritz but I'm not sure if the dress code is worth the hassle lol. I almost never wear suits with tie.",finedining
1730726497.0,Epicure (new menu) and David Toutain ,"First 15ish pictures are Epicure.

I'll just cut to it, I didn't like Epicure at all. The last savory course was pigeon that did not taste good at all. The sauce was bland. The pigeon had no crust, it was a huge disappointment. Me and my wife basically ate 2 bites and left the rest. The other courses were okay. We only really liked the amuse and langostine courses. Dessert was good but straightforward. I had a feeling I should have skipped this given the new chef and menu. Service, ambiance, etc were all 10/10. I felt the longer menu was not worth it over the shorter if you do go.

David Toutain was a good meal. Did the lunch and the shorter menu. It's definitely more on the interesting side than the the carnal this is meat and sauce. I would say if you want some more inventive flavors to try it out. It wasn't ideal for me but I did really like a lot of courses. I think the final savory course which was pork wasnt very good. The desserts were not very good either. It was an insane amount of food. The smaller dishes leading up to the savory were pretty good and interesting. I'd say if your on the fence do the shortest lunch menu.",finedining
1730706836.0,Koks (Tivoli Pop-up) - Copenhagen - October 2024,"Around 2 weeks ago, I dined at the Koks pop-up restaurant inside Copenhagen’s famed Tivoli Gardens amusement park while on a short food trip to Denmark.

A few months prior, Koks had announced that they would be hosting a pop-up at Tivoli from Oct 10th to Nov 3rd after their final season in Greenland. This was not their first rodeo, as they have already done a pop-up here around 2021, back when they were located on the Faroe Islands. 

Koks is one of my dream destination restaurants, but due to its location (Faroe Islands and Greenland), it is extremely hard for me to travel there. So, when I saw the announcement of the restaurant unfortunately only being able to reopen in 2026 and the news of the pop-up being in Copenhagen, I knew I had to come here.

On the night of the dinner, I arrived at the wonderful Tivoli Garden, which was full of Halloween decorations. In order to get into the park and eat at the restaurant, you need to pay an admission fee. I got the entrance pass, which was priced at 180 DKK I believe. The restaurant was operating inside the Japanese Pagoda, a beautiful structure that Tivoli has been using to hold pop-up restaurants since 2021. The Japanese Pagoda was also adorned with Halloween decorations, matching the festive vibe of the entire amusement park. The dining room was very modern, warm wood tones and black carpet, decorated with plants and paper birds hanging on the ceiling, with a view looking out at Tivoli Lake depending on where you are seated. Quite stunning tbh

For the dinner, they offer one dinner tasting menu priced at 2100 DKK, and two drink pairing options: Alcoholic pairing for 1350 DKK and a Non-Alcoholic pairing for 850 DKK. I opted for the dinner tasting menu and one Non-Alcoholic pairing. The NA pairing was very good, including house-made kombucha, infusions, kefir, and even a mocktail. Definitely one of the best NA pairings I’ve had but also very expensive. 

The service here definitely was at a Michelin star level. The front-of-house was professional, friendly, and quite attentive. My water glass was never empty and the food came out at a steady pace. As usual with most New Nordic Restaurants, chefs came out to present and explain majority of the dishes, all of which were understandable and detailed. My only criticism would be the explanations from the servers on courses and drinks could be slightly better, but considering the front-of-house does not include any members of the Koks team, I believe they still did a good job.

Onto the menu: This was basically a shortened version of the menu they serve at Ilimanaq, Greenland. Consisting of 12 courses, each dish was made with ingredients from the Faroe Islands and Greenland. I would describe the food here as super New Nordic in both preparation and presentation, but more experimental and creative than your regular New Nordic restaurant. The plating here is very pretty but also quite simple, besides the bird feather dish. The execution from the kitchen was impressive, the cook of all of the meat courses were great and the plating was tight, this surprised me quite a bit since this was a pop-up and the entire Koks team was not present. Overall, this dinner was delicious and is one of my favorite tasting menus I have had in Denmark. I would love to go to the main restaurant or pop-ups in the near future.

In conclusion, I would definitely recommend people to go try Koks when they reopen, as well as the pop-ups at the Japanese Pagoda (Hiša Franko is coming up next). The meal was ~3100 DKK or 415 € per person, including the admission fee, very expensive but not bad compared to the two Michelin Star restaurants in Copenhagen. This was one of my favorite restaurants on this trip and Tivoli is worth visiting even if you don’t come eat here.

A continuation from my previous post. Here is my second week in Tokyo's restaurant reviews and insights.



**Week 1’s** restaurants are: Ginza Sushi Horinouchi, Sushidokoro Yamato, Sushi Saito Azabudai, Yakitori Omino, Sushi Takeru, Tonkatsu Narikura, Sushi Namba Yotsuya, and Sushi Namba Hibiya.

# Bonus but not really: Sushi Yuki

Access: Easy to find on the ground level near the shopping street of Hiroo. If you’re married and are brining your wife to Yuki, you have to be careful. There is a used/vintage luxury brand store on the way to the restaurant and my wife stopped in….and then other foreigners came in and the husbands were all very sad after leaving. The staff speak English and are very nice lol.

Time/Course: Nigiri only lunch at 12pm, the day after Namba Hibiya.

Gaijin Corner?: n/a, read on

Review: As I rounded the corner from the popular shopping street near the Hiroo station, I sense of doom came over me. A short distance away was Sushi Yuki and outside was an orange cone, a lot of cardboard boxes, cleaning supplies and equipment. I knew immediately this is water damage and my lunch I was looking forward to is at risk. I approach and an assistant is brining out more wet items and I asked him if this is Yuki and he said it was and they had an accident. He called inside to the sous chef and he came out and said my name. I bet I was the only foreigner reserving lol. He said a water pipe leaked and they cancelled all reservations for a couple of days and he went back in to grab his boss. Yuki came out and pointed to his phone and said my name and I understood they tried to contact me – I found the email in my spam box, god damnit. He was closing his eyes and constantly bowing and apologizing for the water leak that shut down. He mentioned he lost a lot of money in a sad tone, I felt bad. He opened up his book and tried to find me a slot that worked with my schedule but unfortunately I was fully booked with reservations for the remaining time. I hope you all can give Sushi Yuki a try. He seems like such a nice guy.

 

# Sumibi Yakiniku Nakahara

Access: A little bit far from the regular Tokyo spots but when you get there, look for the “GEMS” sign and get in the elevator on the ground level and take it straight to floor 9. They’ll greet you at the elevator when you arrive.

Time/Course: 7:30pm Special Course without “Hormones”

Gaijin Corner?: Only available slot was a table unfortunately but I did ask for the counter and they said it was full. It ended up being just 2 couples at the counter for the remainder of the night.

Review: I was surprised to come across this reservation. Nakahara-san was in Thailand for an event during the week preceding and there were no reservations available during that time for I don’t know how long. He got back late on the 25^(th) of October I believe and the 27^(th) opened up for reservations and I was randomly looking at the Tablecheck page for it. The reason being, having dined with Takanashi-san at Namba I was inspired to try to the other restaurant opening in Miami at Ura – Nakahara.

Now, I’ve had these yakiniku fixed course menus before and I can’t say I’ve been a huge fan of that. So approach my review with that lens. You ever have a sushi omakase and feel like you could just repeat the same course over and over again? I understand the want and desire when people ask for the “best al a carte sushi in Tokyo.”  On to the food, the two appetizers – squid and tartare – were nice with former besting the raw beef. The first main course is the 3 varieties of Omi beef tongue (phantom tongue) and I believe this has remained unchanged for years. I think it was quite good and cooking with charcoal over gas definitely has benefit on the end product. Is the tongue standout that you must come here? No, I don’t necessarily think so but I can’t deny it’s a great tasting piece of beef. The sirloin came up next and this is the cut that usually interests me when it comes to yakiniku or wagyu in general, the piece was small per person. It tasted great with the sauce and I asked the waitress cooking it for us what the sauce was. She said it was a secret! She then asked where we were from and I said we are from California, OC to be specific and she replied casually “me too.” I’m like, are you playing with us haha, but she grew up for 10 years in Irvine and I get it now, she kind of has that Cali accent – small world but it made conversing very easy. I continued the conversation asking if Nakahara-san is opening up his Miami location soon. She estimated it would be March of next year and we know that Takanashi-san is likely going after that so maybe they’ll open separately?

Maybe you’re guessing I’m not too high on the food, I think its because I was at a table and if I was at the counter and able to talk to Nakahara himself it would add to the experience. You can hear him talking to the other 2 parties (2 couples) and those guests weren’t really into the conversation. He was explaining with much enthusiasm his purchasing of full cows and how that ended up leading to his burger chain, Henry’s Burgers. The guests never asked questions and the wives tapped out early in to the course with the husbands finishing off their portions. Nakahara did not visit the 5? Tables after the course was over, by the way, so if you are relegated to a table just know that.

Back to the food, and sorry for tangents, sirloin being exceptional we were introduced to a rump and hangar cut I believe. The hangar is tough by its vert nature but full of flavor as you get through it so it was quite nice. The other 3 cuts of meat to follow were fine and not necessarily memorable but you know its high quality its just I prefer eating specific cuts. The last piece was the tri tip and I found this the worst of the bunch. I understand its nice to challenge the perception of a cut of meat because going down to the local US grocery store for a tri tip isn’t necessarily luxury but the piece seemed gristly and I don’t think you should end the raw meat cuts with this one. What followed made up for almost everything – the filet katsu sandwich. This fucking this is 10/10 and blew away any other gyukatsu sandwich I’ve ever had WOW. It’s beautiful and delicious, you can easily bite right through it and sauce was a perfect amount. Now, a lot of people would be full here – no other guest topped up on the final courses – gyudon and noodles. I had 4 gyudon bowls (3 refills) lol. I’m pretty sure I paid for each one too haha. But I did want to eat more and I wasn’t full from the standard course. Oh, the cold noodles at the end were really quite exceptional but I’m not a noodle guy. I’d only return to sit at the counter but my trip to Jambo Hanare might affect that perspective long term.

 

**My Review: 8/10 (10/10 katsu sandwich!)**

 

# Bia Roppongi

Access: Once you find the building you’re all set because the lead server and sommelier will be waiting at the sidewalk for you. So if you see them, just approach and give your reservation name. They’ll lead you to the building’s elevator and enter the floor for you. When you arrive at the restaurant just be really careful as you walk over the pavers and there are steps on the way to the counter. I’ve wondered if anyone has tripped here lol.

Time/Course: Dinner at the counter 8:30pm

Gaijin Corner?: no, relatively centered but it doesn’t really matter as not much prep is done at the counter.

Review: I’ve read some terse recommendations on Reddit about this place and saw a convenient time slot for 2 on the 28^(th) of October. I grabbed it accidentally booked only 1 person so I booked another for my wife. I mention this because [Omakase.in](http://Omakase.in) treated it as 2 reservations, gave me 2 extra points essentially to my score – lifehack! Bia is the brainchild of Beer and there are great reviews about him and history on TokyoGourmet and Tableall. A foodie at heart with a mind for combining his native Thai cuisine with Japanese produce, the outcome is really special. The first dish was hairy crab, crab miso and ankimo, I thought it was okay 😊! The next was a Kinki and Matsutake mushroom Thai soup with a little dumpling of shrimp and it was delicious and I think this is starting the Thai-ness of this all. The next dish is the fried one and it is Pike conger with an eggplant puree and of course lil flowers on top. It was really nice. My neighbors, to my left, were a couple from the Financial District in NYC and they were talking about eating the peppers strewn about as garnish. It started a conversation of the other restaurants we might have been to, they mentioned Jungsik, Ichimura and an Atomix popup all in NYC. I have been to all of them and so we had a fun conversation as the night went on. I really enjoy coming across like minded people on my trips because its rather rare in my social circle.

The notorious shark fin was next and it was so surprisingly tender and stringy and it was sitting in a soft shell turtle sauce that was equally yummy, earthy nutty? I loved it but don’t tell anyone in California I’m eating whale (Namba) and shark on my trip. The following dish is something I still think about the Oswan with abalone – a play on a street food-ish Thai dish (their words). Out of all the dishes this is what I could eat over and over as a full on entrée.  A kuromutsu fish was next up and I didn’t particularly like the taste or the texture of it but the Laab hamburg made up for it. This caviar topped hamburg patty sitting on a bed of spicy Thai spices was super tasty and impressive to behold. The patty is made up of lean meat though so it won’t be as tender as you might think but it didn’t take away from the experience. Tuna and truffle followed and it was sourced from Yamayuki and it was a big fish! Bigger than the sushi restaurants I’ve been to this trip, impressive. I thought it was a well composed dish. But here comes the two kinds of world class curry – holy fuck this shit is awesome. I refilled 3 times and paid the price later that night haha. But anyways both are just so good it will mess with you. Pandan dessert, great, sorbet great. Awesome experience and Beer was so passionate about his food that he crafted. The service staff try very hard and I think they need to slightly improve and they get their long sought Michelin star. The young lady presenting the food was on point, very good. I wonder if she is a cook as well. Speaking of cooking, most of the cooking isn’t done by Beer as you will see Hiroyuki grilling up most everything – looks like hard work! I highly recommend Bia in Roppongi.

 

**My Score: 9/10**

 

# The Pizza Bar on 38th

Access: Kind of tricky for me to find the entrance to the Mandarin Oriental even though I’ve been here before for Tapas lol. But it’s a door on the ground level of the building above the station Mitsukoshimae and I believe its A7 as an exit. Go behind the main escalators and you will see a dark 2 door doorway into the ground level lobby. Take the elevators to the 38^(th) floor (hence the name) and turn left and left again for the restaurant.

Time/Course: Lunch at 1:30pm which is a slightly smaller course than dinner

Gaijin Corner?: Technically in the corner but that means nothing here and it means nothing today, I’ll get to that.

Review: So I’m waiting in the lobby on the 38^(th) floor for the servers to grab us as we were instructed and all of the sudden a bunch of private security arrived on the floor from the elevators. They were all Indian, maybe a dozen or so of them. Following close behind them was the son of the richest man in India and at first I’m like wow cool and then I see them go towards the Pizza Bar and I was like OH NO. All of the Mandarin Oriental staff look unprepared for this moment, for the sheer amount of people and they were all scrambling. On the next lift came out the dad and mom and and some relatives and young ones. All marching towards the Pizza Bar. When 1:30pm hit, an attendant beckoned us and we walked pass the Indian entourage as they took a seat at a table near the bar. There was only 1 couple at the bar, and then me and my wife joined them. 4 seats remained empty and I understand now it was for the family sitting 20 feet away at a table. The son and his wife sat and the parents were standing with security. Chef Cason had his full attention on the family and Lorenzo was preparing and finishing up the first pizza course. He walked it over to the table and a security guard took the whole pizza and dished it out to the family. It looked amazing by the way. But I was like, to myself, that’s our pizza too ☹ After the pizza was consumed, the entire family left but I believe some extended family stayed to drink or snack. When they left Chef Cason went with them too lol. Thankfully Lorenzo and his team usually do the heavy lifting anyways. He said, well we had some last minute cancellations (LOL) and you all get more pizza…HOORAY! Now the course can continue without a hundred people milling around.

This pizza experience is FUCKING INCREDIBLE. They were just awarded 3^(rd) place in the world of pizza, their certificate on the wall next to me. The first course we got to try let us experience the baked dough with a cheese and olive oil dip and I’m like this thing is like crazy light feeling. Later in the course you will be offered to try the dough raw to tough and feel it and taste it, its something so unexpected which comes from the low amount of yeast used to rise the dough and the 2 day resting period for it. Note, there is no correlation between the resting period and the amount of yeast used. They are just wanting the yeast to consume as much sugars as possible and not have it be too active in your belly. This means you won’t have that heavy carb drag after the meal. The pizzas are seasonal to some extend but some routine hits remain like the “grilled cheese” with truffle, awesome stuff. Marinara pizza and Bafala cheese pizza were the first real pizzas and they were so simplistic and yet so beautiful tasting. A mushroom pizza followed but the next one was what I think about to this very moment – a fig and prosciutto pizza with a sweet drizzle of something on top. Many restaurants at this time of year are serving figs with their courses. It was perfection. The formaggi pizza was our last and it was cheesy goodness. Desserts were great but all the hype is real about this place. I’d go back if I’m here in Tokyo again. What a fun place and a lil drama doesn’t hurt.

 

**My Score: 9.5/10**

 

# Yakiniku Jambo Hanare:

Access: Ground level building, easy to find because the windows showcase the kitchen but a bit of a walk from Akihabara.

Time/Course: 5pm al a carte…yay!

Gaijin Corner?: Not a thing, just 6 seats.

Review: I was building this up for months and so happy to go al a carte for this after experiencing the fixed course at Nakahara. I knew exactly what I wanted to eat here and once I sat I started reciting my order to the staff who will eventually be cooking for you too. They handle English quite well and have recommendations for pacing and timing of whatever you order along with the seasoning. You don’t really interact with Chef and the kitchen staff, and that’s okay, and maybe that’s because they were training a new member and she was doing a good job. My order was preordering the Yukhoe rice on Tablecheck along with many orders of Noaharayaki’s, Wagyu sushis, 100g of the filet (chateaubriand was not available for us, sad), and Zabutons. Honestly, I could just order like 10 of the Noharayaki, be full and get out of here for less than Nakahara by a good amount lol. Our bill was so affordable compared to the fixed course at Jambo or Nakahara really. The other 2 couples did not do a fixed course either, all al a carte. The nearest couple was from New Jersey and the husband was Indian so he was able to review my Pizza Bar on 38^(th) footage and confirm what I was seeing and he had many insights on the family. Very nice people to converse with and they were really into the food. Was I? Fuck yes, this place is great. Obviously the Noharayakis are the star of the evening but everything we ordered was beyond delicious. Zabuton I ordered with salt but I think I should have had used the yakiniku sauce option on all of the meat cuts. The yukhoe rice was a great option and I recommend you preorder this if you’re a party of 2. It rounds out the meal if you are even slightly hungry after the beef cuts.

I was in and out of this place in like an hour, completely satisfied and want to come back. Hongo across the street had a huge line so maybe I want to try to get Hanare reservations in the future only. Now that I had a really high end yakiniku al a carte, I’m really not interested in going to Yoriniku or Ushigoro. I just want to eat the exact beef cut I want. I’ll leave omakase to sushi and kaiseki.

 

**My Score: 9.5/10**

 

# Sushi Ryujiro

Access: Ground level building off a side street with a very obvious tiled driveway, can’t miss it. Doors opened 3 minutes before the reservation time.

Time/Course: Nigiri course at lunch, 12pm

Gaijin Corner?: Nope! I sat immediately to Nakamura-san’s right. Good seat near the corner of the bar.

Review: I’ve dined with Ryujiro Nakamura at Umi in 2017 and he didn’t have much English back then and was very hesitant to interact with me but was very talkative to my Japanese friends. That’s okay, I can’t speak Japanese. Has he changed much since then? I guess not particularly. But he is ever enthusiastic at presenting his sushi in English and Japanese with a really kind, genuine face. He is very good at his formation of sushi, he is great with a knife and it’s a pleasure to watch him (I was gaijin cornered at Umi back in the day and couldn’t see much). Oh, since both of his counters start at the same time, just know if you are a main counter reservation you go straight when entering the shop, sub counter is an immediate right. Now, I didn’t take much note of the seating process at Sushi Takeru last week but I think he gets it from Nakamura? The assistants guide you into the room and Takeru or Ryujiro will put their hands on their hips, look at you, look at the bar and “decide” where you will sit. I can’t tell if this is theater but I like it because it feels impromptu and unbiased haha. Nakamura-san pointed to a seat to his right like I mentioned. I sat next to Japanese regulars (a couple) who seem to have a nice relationship with chef. The room was those 2 japanese, wife and I (Asian american’s of course), a Korean husband and wife sat directly in front of Ryujiro. These two were fucking full on enthused and I love seeing that wherever I go as its level of appreciation I hope some have. So us 6 ordered the nigiri only course. If you’re wondering if you would feel weird ordering the lesser costing course, don’t. That meant 60% of the room was nigiri only and it was very filing and if you’re on a time crunch Nakamura-san is very time efficient at lunch. PLUS his second chef handles the full-on lunch omakase folks, the 4 mixed Japanese on the far right of the room (until nigiri). So a nigiri only course order means Ryujiro is handling you right off the bat, this is great. Chef is really good at monitoring the state of the bar, always making sure his assistants are aware of drink levels. He asked me a few times if I wanted refills of ice green tea and water (I don't drink alcohol, the ole liver) and would call out for his drink assistants, a young man and woman handle the service.

Food time! Pumpkin soup to start, careful this was hot and I was like whoops. I am very sensitive to heat as it can ruin a trip. I went to Hachigou last year for ramen and it was scalding on the first sip and my tongue was burned for 1-2 days haha. Anyways, Nakamura-san has this huge knife going at the fish and fileting up the final courses as much of the rest was already done. Ika and a baby squidy thing were the first two pieces and they were very good and now I remember his shari and I really like it a lot – just slightly sour with a good temperature. The buri was beautiful and also very delicious but this katsuo up next had a diamond pattern cut into it and that was gorgeous and clean. Pen shell with a seaweed wrap was the best of the trip I think! The tuna offerings were Akami and Otoro, they were quite good as well but thinly cut. Kohada was 8.5/10 and the ikura-don was just alright. Uni was exceptional, tastes great, looks great and was given a good amount! Dude, I fucking love it when an uni box is getting close to empty and chef has to decide what he does with it and two times they added more to my piece (Ryujiro today and Suzuki at the end of the trip). A deep miso soup arrives as the tuna makis are being prepared. Each couple has their own maki, so 3 were made and sliced into 4 pieces, 2 per person. These are large and filling and the tuna scraps were lean but very tasty. The second chef was working like mad all lunch and he was preparing the eel and cucumber maki that will round out the course. Though it was not bad, I would prefer an eel nigiri as it felt small as a maki. The egg here is not like the egg cake things you see a lot of the time, it’s a more traditional tamagoyaki and bursts with flavor. I can appreciate it and Takeru’s a lot after all the cakey things. With the lunch over it was time for any add ons and Nakamura-san asked us one by one if we were full. The couple next to me added a kanypo roll. I ordered the kappa maki! I was so looking forward to this large cucumber maki and if you order it, use generous amounts of soy sauce they provide you, its delicious!! Go Kappa maki! We paid the bill and proceed to leave first amongst the guests and chef chased after us to walk us to the drive. He and his female drink server watched us depart and at that time I chatted briefly that we were first met in Umi (not that he would remember) and congratulations on his own place along with the Michelin star retention. I pointed to the white congratulatory flowers adorning the building. One set was from Yamayuki themselves talking about maintaining their Michelin Star for 2025. [Omakase.in](http://Omakase.in) provided the same set of flowers with the same sentiment. Very nice of them! I highly recommend this very cost effective lunch. I can’t comment on the full course as I couldn’t see it very well from across the bar. I prefer nigiri though anyways 😊

 

**My Score: 9/10**

 

# Den

Access: A bit of a walk into Jimbocho but its essentially ground level with many windows facing the street so you can’t miss it. And they won’t miss you. Once they see you come into sight they rush out to greet you.

Time/Course: 6:30pm dinner omakase, we were the 3^(rd) group sat for the night.

Gaijin Corner?: Not really possible, they sat me dead center at the communal table facing the kitchen. How can I put this, it’s a bit weird if you’re a first timer as you make casual eye contact with every member of the staff. The regulars loved it though as they knew everyone :D

Review: Let’s just get it out of the way, one of the best dining experiences of my life. I’ve been trying to get into Den since maybe 2016? But having to plan so far ahead, it never worked out for me vacations as they were very impromptu. But here I was, finally and fucking hell its truly like family and all of the return guests exude that from their persons. Chef Hasegawa must have had some celebrities in the restaurant today but there was a big thing going on when a party came in but I don’t know enough about Japanese pop culture. But he gave everyone equal attention and when I sat for the evening he mentioned we would be using figs tonight. I made mention I was just at Pizza Bar on 38^(th) and we had a fig pizza and he was like “what the.. they never served me a fig pizza before, I’m going to call them right now.” Lol!! Noriko, the main support staff told me that Chef is really close with Cason and the sous chefs and I told him the pizza was amazing and he placed a hand over his heart in distress. Noriko proceeded to describe the first dish, the monaka cookie. We were asked to guess what was inside and I guessed ankimo, liver, and strawberry jam. I was a bit wrong, it was foie gras and raspberry preserves! Soooo good! Really really awesome. A chawanmushi of followed and it was very very good and it was large too. Obviously the Dentucky fried chicken was coming up because they placed the kissing birds plate on our table. The perfectly fried wing was stuffed with rice and sweet potatoes. Amazing yet again. Having never been here before, I was saddened when they took the monaka wrapper away to discard and the Dentucky fried chicken box was also taken but to be resused….NOOO I wanted it lol. Buri sashimi with boiled nori sauce and wasabi was given next and the fish was marinated slightly in soy sauce. This was really incredible quality yellowtail and the seaweed was so sweet like the chawanmushi topping at Yamato. The bowl it came in was gorgeous and makes attractive photography. Noriko described the next dish as a fried swordfish like fish with a sweetened soy sauce and greens. This was my tempura fix for the trip and was so good I spent moments trying to drink all of the sauce with a wooden spoon.

A European couple came in at this time and he was a return visitor, wife was her first time though and they all called out to him when he entered. Everyone here, along with Emi, chef’s wife, were so sweet and anticipatory. Everything here is genuine and there is a lot of care in food and service. The famous Den salad was being prepared and I couldn’t wait to see it. Some 15 different types of greens and vegetables populated the bowl and all were prepared in different ways. Noriko playfully called attention to what looked like a root vegetable of some sort. My wife asked what it was and she was like, “oh there’s dirt all over it"". It truly looked like they ripped some root vegetable from the ground and tossed it into the bowl. It was actually a baby carrot dressed in tea powder to simulate soil. It was one of the best tasting parts of the salad! Soup was to follow with green onions and wagyu sirloin. This hits the spot everything was perfect again in it.

A clay pot was taken from the counter and I knew rice was being prepared and I was curious what seasonal topping would be used in the pot. I’ve seen wagyu, eel and Ikura. Today was Ikura and a side of pickled vegetables and miso soup completed the presentation. I overheard another guest talk about topping up the rice and ikura after the first serving was done so I finished my quickly and they offered a refill. I finished the second just as fast and they offered a refill! So 3 bowls of delicious ikura rice for me yay! I was quite full at this time, no one else really got seconds or thirds of the rice.  A tofu based dessert rounded out this world class meal. Food being great, you’ll take away the family like atmosphere and prefect service. You want to experience that love over and over. It feels so real even though you’ve only known them 2 hours.

 

**My Score: 10/10 easy!**

 

# Ginza Kitafuku

Access: Look for the “Ginza 745” building and proceed to Floor 3. Turn left and enter and you’ll be greeted by a kimono-clad staff who will seat you in one of the 3 private rooms, just 3. Now you understand why it may be difficult to get this reservation.

Time/Course: 8:30pm Hairy Crab course

Gaijin Corner?: Private rooms only at the Ginza location. Other locations have bar seating though.

Review: Since December of 2016 I’ve been trying to get into this restaurant and just like Den it was difficult to manage on a short term basis. So 8 years in the making, I’m here with the wife. I’ve had live king crab courses at Ikenani Hokuto in Akasaka so I wanted to try a hairy crab one and with this selection each person gets one extra large hairy crab to themselves. The course starts with figs and persimmon, figs is definitely a thing now and I’m totally good with that. Appetizers follow, of beautiful Yamayuki otoro and chutoro sashimi and fish + mushroom soup. This was all very good and prepares you for whats coming. I was so happy tom know Kaneda-san was going to be our chef. Yay! He brought in a wooden circular tray of our 2 live hairy crabs and we took a bunch of videos and pictures. He deftly began the live preparation. Word of warning, they will be disassembled alive right in front of you. Legs were removed for the various preparations: sashimi, tempura and shabu shabu. The sashimi legs were miraculously sweet and much better than my live king crab tastings offered. After the sashimi course was devoured, chef walked in with a full box of uni and asked me if I wanted to add it to the course. I knew this was coming so I asked what the price was and as expected it was 20,000 yen. I said yes immediately thereafter. Who would have fucking known, just chillin’ with a box of uni and using it at your discretion was the best thing to happen to food. I put uni on the tempura, on the shabu shabu, and on the next course coming. The body of the crab was hollowed out and filled with all the remaining bits of meat from the crab along with the miso (in a separate cup). It was a large amount of meat and I was getting full just starting to tackle it. And yes, I took a scoop of uni and dumped it on top of the meat then poured the innards all over both. I asked for the rice because I really wanted to eat the crab with rice. So out came a beautiful steel pot of rice but it didn’t come alone. A large bowl of ikura accompanied it and I was like whoa. Whats up? Chef scooped rice into two bowls and start drizzling ikura all over. Awesome! And yes, I took another scoop of uni and put it on top of that mixed it all up. This is an absurd amount of food. It wasn’t over though. Side dishes immediately followed of miso soup, grilled fish, pickled vegetables and cooked wagyu beef. Lord have mercy. I’m actually dying. I still managed to polish off all the rice as my wife couldn’t help much. The crab and uni were all gone too. This was a pricey pricey meal but I’m so happy I could experience it finally. If you’re rolling deep, maybe you can give it a try. I feel its very much worth it.

 

**My Score: 9.5/10**

 

# Sushi Suzuki

Access: Just relocated to a new building, look for bevezel steel trim surrounding 2 glass doors on the ground level (see google review pictures). Take the elevator elevator to the 5^(th) floor and turn left and then right. If you’re early people will be waiting outside with you. The doors open on the dot.

Time/Course: Lunch nigiri course, 12pm

Gaijin Corner?: No! Just slightly off center. When being sat, Suzuki-san’s wife will have a list of names and I saw my name had a JPNEZY note next to it but so did another couple. They were America and sat in the typical Gaijin corner in the far back of the room. So the JPNEZY thing doesn’t carry any special treatment I don’t think.

Review: Since this is a couple ran shop, there are no assistants and the beginning phases of this course involve getting drink orders, Suzuki-san or his wife randomly taking them, and chef confirming preferences and allergies. Now, you know I’ve been to a lot of restaurants this trip by now and no one has ever had a preference or allergy. This room had all kinds of stuff. There was only 1 Japanese fellow and he sat dead center and maintained most of the conversation with Suzuki-san. One couple couldn’t eat squid? One person couldn’t do toppings on fish, like ginger or the green onion things on Aji. One person said she couldn’t take any wasabi and that was interesting. Anyways, onto the food!

Suzuki-san makes incredibly beautiful sushi, the preparation and formation are perfect photography material. The lunch course is on the expensive side of things but fuck the rice here is top tier. I wish I asked for super-sized shari because its really that good. I’ll add the neta is all great quality with tuna being especially, especially delicious. I think temperature of the fish can be worked on though. Every course was killer, hit after hit. Kurama ebi and aka gai are stand outs for me. The couple that couldn’t eat squid? Thank god for them because Chef brought out Torigai to supplement it (is pen shell really all that different from squid? I don’t know if it was preference or allergy related). I was kind of expecting a sabazushi but not to be had and we had a nice fatty tuna maki at the end. With the torigai being in the fish box, 3 of us asked for it as an add on with a Chinese couple to the far right also adding on Hamaguri. I believe they might have read your review Tokyo Gourmet! This is very straightforward sushi done to a really high level. I’d recommend it if you can somehow not pay the JPNEZY upcharge.

 

**My Score: 9.5/10**

 

Well that’s all, my lunch at Suzuki was on the day I flew out. Everything I did this trip worked out pretty well and I had very positive experiences everywhere. I’m very fortunate but I believe all of these craftsmen are the real deal, genuine and good people.",finedining
1730686111.0,"Sushi Sakai (Tabelog Gold, Fukuoka)","Booked through TableCheck early July, 11am seating was last October 31. If I'm not mistaken, Sushi Sakai may be the only Tabelog Gold sushi place that you can still book ""directly"" online, without paying additional charges from third party reservation sites.

Things started with a bang with the uni and shrimp and the ikura and crab (though the ikura wasn't ""explosive"" with sea essence as it pops inside your mouth).

The fugu with ankimo sauce (fourth photo) was distinctive. First time having pufferfish in an omakase.

Not an expert in edomae sushi by any means, but I noticed Chef Sakai served the kohada ahead of the maguro threesome (akami, chutoro, otoro). My previous omakase experiences had the gizzard shad being served after the tuna.

Among the nigiri, the conger eel was the standout. Literally melts in your mouth. May be the best anago I've had.

Chef's Sakai's rice (lightly vinegared, far from the acidic ""Jiro-style"" variety) is phenomenal, at times eclipsing the neta.

1730674501.0,"Aubergine (**), Carmel","Based on the many rave reviews here and the fact that Aubergine has recently won its 2nd star, we came very hyped but left rather disappointed.

5/10. I’m a mid-rare guy and can very much enjoy a well-done steak, but this was on the verge of being overcooked. No-one asked us how we liked our steak done. I can say without exaggeration that I cook better ribeye myself.

8: A5 wagyu supplement 
9/10. Cooked just right with Aubergine’s „triple sear“ method. 4oz (for an additional $220) was more than enough for the two of us.

10: hibiscus granita, apple, lime, white chocolate pistachios
8/10

Service was good but not very engaging. No-one bothered to take my wife’s coat when we were led to our table - we had to actively ask. Sommelier was rather terse and told us little about the wines we chose. The red in pic 9 he suggested for the beef course was 10/10 though. The nicest part of the service was when Chef Justin brought us two courses himself and engaged in a brief conversation. 

The ambiance is nice enough but nothing spectacular. There are several tables where couples were seated side by side, which my wife and me wouldn’t have preferred. The music - a nondescript alternative rock playlist - didn’t fit the mood at all in my opinion, but that’s clearly my personal preference.

In the end, our tally came to $1400 including the wagyu supplement, a $100 bottle of white, a $50 glass of red, a non-alcoholic beverage pairing and two cocktails at the bar. This by far exceeds what we spent e.g. at La Pergola (***) in Rome last year, where we had 12 courses and two wine pairings. For a $1000+ dinner, we’d expect to be blown away by at least three courses. Here, we had two really good courses, one of which (the wagyu) came at a hefty extra price. 

We don’t regret going, but even if Aubergine was close to our home, we wouldn’t come again.

# Ginza Sushi Horinouchi

Access: Easy to find, ground level street in Ginza.

Vibe: Casual, not too fussy. We were the only foreigners in the seating of 7.

Time/Course: Lunch Omakase

Gaijin Corner?: Yes, to the right.

Review: First restaurant on my vacation, flew in at 5am and this was a 12pm lunch. Struggling to stay awake and hope Horinouchi-san didn’t take too much offense. I liked the restaurant’s design, inside and out and chef and his wife were very hospitable. Horinouchi-san seemed to have regulars in the seating and focused on them (4 of the 7). Though the conversation focused on them he didn’t speak all that much. Thus we didn’t feel like we were missing out and enjoyed the sushi making show. The size of the sushi was considerably large and I loved that. The shari was super vinegared and I enjoyed that as a shock to the ole tastebuds as its been awhile since I’ve had sushi (January ’23 was the last time I was in Tokyo). Tuna was the focus, it came first and the last course was a large tuna futomaki. 2 of the regulars were older women and could hardly eat after the first few courses and Horinouchi-san kept good measure on their pace and eventually they gave up and he stopped making sushi for them. They didn’t end up going through the same check-out process like the rest of us so maybe he knew them personally. Better for the rest of us though because when it got to the tuna maki, he cut it into 5 and it was huge, lol. It was mostly otoro scraps and super fatty. Yum! Though tuna was his thing, the Iwashi and Kohada were the stars for me, they tasted awesome and looked visually great. His wife kept everyone’s drinks topped up even while dealing with quite a few people walking in trying to make reservations. I can understand, the lunch omakase was insanely filling due size of shari and neta and from a cost performance perspective it can be alluring. Would definitely come back again and am interested in his dinner omakase but the lunch deal is so hard to pass up. It isn’t necessarily easy to book though. This lunch seating appeared all at once on [Omakase.in](http://Omakase.in) even with months of reservations being available. I feel like I sniped this away from regulars.

**My score: 8/10**

# Sushidokoro Yamato

Access: Ground level, easy to find in Tsukiji/Ginza border.

Time/Course: Dinner Omakase

Gaijin Corner?: No! Sat right in front of Chef Yamato, yay!

Review: So this was a 5pm seating after my 12pm seating with Horinouchi-san on the first day I arrived. Brutally tired and did everything I could to look awake but I had a great time. Word of warning, English is not a thing and I was the only foreigner in the whole place. Off to the left were 2 regulars (corner), my immediate left had an interesting dynamic with the guy of the couple seemingly subservient to the young girl who was quite rambunctious (maybe she was pregaming before coming here). To my right was a first timer and the 2 in the right corner were in their own universe and Yamato-san had to pace them completely differently. They were 2-3 courses behind always as they were fully engrossed in conversation and wine. Interestingly enough, after the guy went to the bathroom at the end of the meal, one of the guys to the far left starting talking to the girl on the right. And now I could understand why he looked slightly distraught the whole meal, lol. Oh sorry, back to meal. So yeah, if you don’t understand Japanese, like me, might be a tough time but its very doable. All of those Google reviews implying racism or whatever seem bullshit. The staff knew I was likely full on Gaijin and prepared a few sticky notes to better serve me. When being sat after giving my name, one of the staff presented one sticky note with all their non-alcoholic drinks in English, curiously they serve Pepsi here over Coke. I went with my staple hot tea (this will change over the trip because it is hot as hell in Tokyo in October). Appetizers came and they were great, katsuo is my stand out but the chawanmushi with boiled seaweed, wow, very fun. Okay heads up on people saying they weren’t served courses others received (Google reviews again). After the regular otsunami was served you will be presented with options to add more of them – the attendant called them “snacks”. I think this is where people get confused because they might ask you first and you’re sitting there dumbfounded. The server of drinks presented a post it note and tried to translate live what they have to add on during the otsunami course but I knew the names of the stuff I like and simply said I just want the ankimo, done and no problem I got my ankimo (everyone ordered that) and I’m set. But they had ikura and a dried fish roe as the 2 other options with 2 people ordering ikura. Nigiri started and Gizzard Shad up front and center, it was great and obviously you understand its my thing, lol. Honestly, I’ve not been really impressed by this flounder that came up and never was impressed with it my entire trip as I got it everywhere. Maybe not my thing then. Tuna was not a focus and there was akami and otoro but they were very good, 8.5? Sawara great, Kurama ebi great. Everything else was quite good. Great value for a dinner!! Oh by the way, I have to add a caveat again. After uni is served this is where you can add on nigiri so be ready to give the names of the ones you want to repeat. I added nothing as I was about to pass-out from food and sleep deprivation. My typical add on is Kohada and Madai though. Yamato-san himself, was super kind and presented in English whenever he could. Genuine guy, great craftmsan.

 **My score: 8.5/10**

 

# Sushi Saito Azabudai

Access: This can be difficult for people to find I guess? I was mentally prepared and found it very easily in the Azabudai market but 4 people were lost for about 10 minutes and the second chef had to run them down in the market. It is a tiny room with a restaurant door next to the “sushi” area of the market.

Time/Course: Lunch Omakase

Gaijin Corner: Yes! Unfortunately but with the second chef serving the left side of the restaurant, it was okay for me and had a good view of the action.

Review: Man I love this place but you probably can tell I’m not really traditionally scoring these restaurants? I love vibe, experience, drama, chef interaction along with amazing food. I’ll say it upfront, the shari here is HOT, okay maybe super warm but will be HOT for many and I can’t believe how much I love it haha. It feels like I’m eating a lil entrée in every course (I’m Filipino I love rice, man). Okay, rice aside the Tuna offering here is quite good with chutoro being the weakest of the bunch. Ebi, great, Uni Ikura don, its cute. Sawara very good. Chef Takamito-san doesn’t know much English so be prepared again, when you get your marginal-tuna maki to order more at that time. He might struggle to ask but if one of his servers that knows English is around you might be okay. They did the best to translate on the fly for me but understood I knew most of the sushi names so it was just the add-on moment that needed their translation efforts. What was conveyed to me is I couldn’t select something that wasn’t served at lunch, no Madai for me. I repeated the Kohada and it was free! Yay! It was delicious. After the addons for everyone was over and we were all full, the egg came out in what I can describe as a custard with a sugary layer over it? Fucking hell, this was amazing. I want to keep coming back to Saito Azabudai and was trying to book another round during the trip to no avail, lol.

**My Score: 8.5/10 (9/10 for hot rice but I feel it would skew things for people)**

 

# Yakitori Omino:

Access: Ground level building, easy to find, but maybe a trek out of central Tokyo for some.

Time/Course: Lunch

My Review: I’m a sushi and yakiniku guy. Saying that, my wife got tired of that real quick and I booked Omino to break up the sushi monotony for her. I would say, I can understand why they are maintaining the Michelin Star here, their service is fucking on point and it made it a really nice experience. Look, the chicken was tasty and the vegetables maybe even moreso. Chicken thigh with wasabi was great but I couldn’t make it to the oviducts I was getting so full so fast. I think I made it into like 16/17 skewers and so to the others seated with me, the ones who made it congratulations. I didn’t partake in the oyakudon which was offered after I threw in the towel, that was nice of them. I’d come back for the crazy tofu thing alone. I was surprised I didn’t smell like smoke after so that’s something.

**My Score: 8/10**

 

# Sushi Takeru

Access: Second floor of the building, you can take the stairs on the left for a quick trip up but the elevators are in the center if required. They open the doors right at the time of your reservation so there was like 6 people waiting at the door and it was kind of hot in Tokyo so don’t feel like you need to get here early.

Time/Course: 8:45pm dinner omakase, same day as Omino. I’m struggling here lol.

Gaijin Corner?: Nope, I think only “bad seats” are to the right but the room is tight and cozy so everyone has a good view here.

My Review: I met Watanabe-san back in his Arai days which was like 2017/2018 at the second counter. It was really fun back then and I was pleasantly surprised to see he had his own restaurant, I just never recalled his first name being Takeru and missed out on my previous trip to Tokyo. Knowing his lineage, I knew tuna was going to be a thing here but his ebi appetizer, Kurama ebi, ankimo+watermelon and kohada is what would call me back. The tuna offering was 2 types of chutoro, akami and otoro but there was also a tuna based maki at the end as well! All delicious and sourced from Yamayuki, he can show you the receipts for a picture if you’re interested. Chef made small talk with me about our previous experience and what I’ll be doing for the rest of trip. He asked if I am going to Arai, I laughed and said I wouldn’t be allowed to for my entire life most likely. I did say I was going to Ryujiro (especially since he served as Second Chef there) and he told me was hanging out with Nakamura-san just 2 days before (Monday) and was wondering I got the main counter reservation. I did, yes, thankfully. One note, I don’t think the kinki can stand up to the heavy hitters so that’s my only criticism here. The egg to finish would end up reminding me of Ryujiro’s style. I would come back just to hang out with chef. He is a really nice person, warm and friendly. Service was on point, his second chef was hard working and I hope he gets more confidence because I can tell he’s still nervous. I understand he’s been around since day 1 though. The crowd was mostly foreigners, with 2 Japanese – an older couple – coming from outside of Tokyo to celebrate their anniversary, very cute.

**My Score: 8.5/10**

 

# Tonkastu Narikura

Access: Has its own building over in Asagaya so it was a trip from Ginza, maybe 40ish minutes. When you’re walking up to it from the main street, the door you’ll first see (all black on an all black wall) is not the door you’ll enter. Round the building’s corner and you’ll see another door with a bench off to the side. Don’t open the door, it is locked. The staff will get you from outside at the time of your reservation. On a pillar infront of that one bench is a the menu for add-ons. So just chill out there for a minute or two and they’ll seat you shortly.

Gaijin Corner?: Not thing, but I got a table seat instead of counter. I think counter will be interesting but I don’t know if you’re missing out on anything particularly special as I didn’t hear chef chat with anyone. There is a lot to learn about their produce and process though so I was surprised no one tried.

Review: When you’re reserving this restaurant on [Omakase.in](http://Omakase.in) you will feel pressured to order whatever you can as fast as you can as the reservations are quite competitive. I knew what I wanted though. I’ve see reviews with people ordering the fatty cuts of pork and honestly it wasn’t that interesting to me as I’ve had fatty tonkatsu plenty of times and I really can’t handle it. I decided for just 2 entrees, the chateaubriand and loin. As I got through my salad and was presented with the chateaubriand, I was worried. It looked small and I was thinking I made a mistake and I should have ordered 3 entrees but I did add on one take-away sandwich so maybe I’ll be okay overall? No mistake was made. After devouring the 2 halves of my first course and finishing the rice off completely, I was like…hey that was pretty heavy. I topped up the rice bowl for 200 yen and waited for the loin to come out. It was larger in size and leaner looking. The chateaubriand is slightly undercooked for pork but it was perfection. The loin looked cooked through, as it was purely white with that small rim of fat on one side. Regardless of its leaness, you bite through this piece, it was so amazingly tender. It took me 4 bites and it was all gone (along with the second rice bowl). At this point, I felt really full. I was so surprised. Heads up, there is a “card” with instructions on how to eat the tonkatsu with varying sauce/seasoning. Forget all of that, their tonkatsu sauce works on everything, lol. I could eat here every day its so good. Pricey though and difficult to get reservations and far from Tokyo (kind of). The takeaway sandwich was so good. You can order 3 by the way. Maybe that was the only true mistake, I only ordered 1.

**My Score: 10/10 for the Tonkatsu world of food.**

 

# Sushi Namba Yotsuya:

Access: Side street, ground level, easy to find. The area seems to have many, many bars with a lively crowd. Interesting place for a sushi restaurant of this caliber. This is semi-private so finding reviews, is not a thing. Not easily google-able for it’s address unless you search in Japanese.

Time/Course: 7:30pm Dinner Omakase

Gaijin Counter?: Nope, front and center, yay!

Review: So I wouldn’t have even known about this place unless it was for Tokyo Gourmet and m046186 but thank god for them. It was really great to experience Takanashi-san’s work before he jets off across the world to Miami. I feel like I had my own little version of a future $10,000.00 buy in omakase at Ura. In reality, this is just Namba Hibiya version 2.0 and that’s more than enough for me or for anyone! The seating was surprisingly foreigner, 3 koreans, wife and I, and 3 Japanese to my right. I loved their energy, the Japanese. 2 on the most right came from outside Tokyo to experience this and they were so appreciative. But the Japanese guy sitting next to me was beyond excited and ecstatic. He could hardly contain himself on how special this was for him. That was so awesome. The Koreans were nice buy kept asking about alcohol offerings, there’s no menu guys lol. It was just one sake, no more sake questions please lol. Chef was wondering what the heck was going on over there sometimes as they kept on bugging the assistants. Thankfully one of the assistants was South Korean himself and spoke Japanese, Korean and English so proper and fluidly. I can tell there’s a real passion and future for this dude anywhere in the world. Sorry to start the food review with this, but there was a huge pile of ankimo on the counter as we were being sat. So sorry Tokyo Gourmet, lol!! I can’t tell why it was there, no other fish was being prepared before we sat. It was just there and we were all amped looking at it. And I knew, personally what I was going to do with this opportunity. ANKIMO KANPYO FUTOMAKI TIME! Okay, okay, food. Takanshi-san grilled up an amazing eel, crunchy, but no sauce. Perfect. We got our ankimo appetizer to wet our tongue and it was yummy and I couldn’t wait to see if he’d let me order the maki after the course was over. The Yotsuya version of Namba serves the same food as the Hibiya version as the cards are exactly the same for the day. Appetizers will differ. As the nigiri is prepared (which he prepares most of the Hibiya ones too) you’ll see him finely cut the Ika into thin layers. It is really special to watch, he is great with a knife. This was the first time I will be served clams, pen shell or tairagai, after the ika and this is one of my favorites. The texture and feel tonight was truly awesome. Baby flounder was probably the best of the trip until I got to Hibiya later that weekend. The heart clam, Torigai, man that was really good too. Fuck his Iwashi and bonito are great. Then I get to something I don’t recall having for years filefish with liver, holy smokes is that rich. I think the Spanish maceral was fine, I just don’t really like salt toppings taking place of soy sauce. Shiba ebi came up next lol, fuck this would kill people out of pure ecstasy. Tuna came up next and it was perfect. Otoro and Akami had their own rice made for themselves. More vinagered, darker, slightly warmer. Good choice here. Kohada was okay but the uni was great. Takanshi-san doesn’t have a great command of English but can speak a little bit. I think the Korean assistant should go with him to Miami and I did ask him and he said he is hoping he is chosen for the adventure. When the course was over and we were invited to order more, the whole room seemed ready to go. The Koreans added otoro and Takanashi-san had a small sana of a different belly cut. Much more pronounced layers. They also added sawara, kanpyo maki and torigai. I’ve never seen so much add ons before because the Japanese were about to order. The two to the right added the same otoro and that was basically all gone. The excited man sitting next to me wanted a maki and a bunch of words rolled off his tongue, all different types of fish and toppings. What it came out to be was a futomaki of egg, gourd, ankimo, tuna, eel, and some other stuff I probably forgotten. It got boxed up really prettily and the implication it was for his partner. I ordered the ankimo kanypo futomaki and Takanashi-san stepped back. I got scared a bit because he is a quiet stoic kind of guy but this sparked him. He though for a moment and said “ankimo futomaki?” I’m like please? I heard about it on the internet, I replied. He said back to me “Instagram? Right?” Nope, it was my internet friend m046186 haha. But really I said it was a friend that visited him many times before. He tried to guess who it was but I don’t know m046186’s real name anyways. Ultimately, he said “ok sure!” but that he can only do a half size (in length) which was perfect because I was scared I had to order a full maki and that would set me back huge money, I know it. He is incredibly generous with the ankimo and was stuffing this roll like mad. He garnished it differently than I’ve seen on the internet with oboro, eel sauce and wasabi on top. It was fucking amazing, I was so happy. Yay! What a wonderful meal with Takanashi-san.

**My Score: 9.5/10 (9/10 if no ankimo futomaki!!!!, help!)**

# Sushi Namba Hibiya

Access: Difficult without preparation maybe? I had to do dry runs for this and it paid off for him. This reservation was 2 days after Yotsuya and between these two dinners was a train ride to Ubuya at Mt. Fuji and a train ride back the next afternoon. I would have 3 hours to get from Kawaguchiko Station to Hibiya Station in Tokyo. I determine Ginza station would be best for logistics and did 2 practice runs before leaving for Mt. Fuji. Hibiya was too complicated for me so Ginza was a surface walk from the exit near Ginza 5 Department start nothwest along the main street until I get to Wendy’s. If you’re looking at Wendy’s turn 180 degrees and walk past the outdoor movie theater until you get to a small building with an escalator going down to the basement level. There is a 7-11 and some cafes in this area but look for 2 short escalators on the opposite side of the larger escalator you just took. Go up a floor and enter the food hall to your left and then look immediately to the right after entering. Those are the elevators you need to take to the 3^(rd) floor. Turn left after the elevator ride and you’ll be at Namba Hibiya.

Time/Course: 5pm Dinner Omakase

Gaijin Corner?: Hard to say there is one in the Hanare room but Hanare room is awesome! Forget the main counter, the hanare room is perfect for me or for anyone. You’re basically 4 people surrounding Namba-san and its so close and intimate. Don’t consider the side room some downgrade, its definitely a great experience.

Review: I just was at Yotsuya so I expected a very similar experience. I was wrong. Namba Hibiya has much better appetizers, maybe even more of them. They are different almost entirely. The eel is better here as was the matsutake mushroom dish along with the abalone. Whale sashimi was unique to Hibiya and it was fantastic. The Korean assistant was here tonight along with everyone else from Yotsuya. They were surprised I was here too and Takanshi-san stepped into the room to ask if I was staying in Tokyo much longer and how things were in California. Appetizers here are mainly served by the assistants and Namba-san was kind of just getting ready to make nigiri. This was a 5pm dinner so as you guessed Namba-san was already pretty tired and winded. Tokyo Gourmet was right that a lunch seating might be best if you are a chatty person. So the appetizers are better than Yotsuya, what about the nigiri? Yes, it was all better. I don’t have any reason why, I’m not that technical but they taste better here at the main shop. The sardine so excellent, the bonito somehow better? The kombu and mackerel thing was unique to the shops and was so fucking good. The menu had just 2 tuna nigiri again buuuut after the Kohada (which was after the 2 tuna pieces) Takanashi-san emerged from the kitchen. We didn’t know but he was cutting up 4 pieces of tuna for us. So a third tuna came out, it looked quite similar to the fatty tuna but just ever so slightly more fatty. Delicious. I asked Hide about the rice and he said he makes it just for the tuna and the sourness is perfect for the fish. I believed him, it works. Thank you for the extra tuna Namba-san!! Uni doesn’t come as nigiri here but as a uni don.  Maybe I prefer Takananshi-san’s preparation for this course. Eel is better here and so is the egg to finish. I didn’t add anything on tonight, I was very full. The nigiri has been criticized as being small at Namba but I left both locations feeling very very satisfied. Namba-san is so subtlety funny and I regret not knowing a lot of Japanese to chat with him. The humor maybe is dry but he makes this experience even more memorable. I love it here. Really incredible and fun. Luckily, I was in the room with some foodie types. A Thai was on the far right and we spoke briefly of him visiting Gaggan. To my right was an American from Boston who travels a lot for food. He first met Namba at the NYC event for the announcement of Ura in Miami and I think it got him hooked on sushi.

1730583161.0,"Sushi Kotan (Fukuoka, Tabelog Bronze)","Visited Sushi Kotan in Fukuoka in October 2024. The chef trained at Mizutani and Hashimoto before opening his own shop in Fukuoka. Within 14 months of opening, the shop was awarded Tabelog Bronze.

The dinner started with 7  otsumami -  highlights being the barracuda, bonito, white tilefish (heard it is a rare catch) & matsutake chawanmushi. All came in small portions just sufficient to whet the appetite in advance of the nigiri flight ahead.

Neta were large and generous. Rice was very grainy, which I found to be enjoyable as it provided textural contrast against the softer fish, while the seasoning more on the mellow side (I prefer punchier shari). Haven’t been to Hashimoto, so not sure if the style is the same as his old taisho.

The edomae modus operandi is clear and overall, a solid meal. Not to say I loved every piece, for instance, that day’s maguro came from Shimame and it tasted like summer tuna.

Paid 26,400 yen for 7 otsumami and 13 nigiri. Noting this is a 20% increase from the previous month price of 22,000 yen which was probably under-valued and overdue for a hike.

Booked via omakase. The website initially froze as people flocked to make reservations when the window opened. But around 20 minutes later, the storm seemed to pass and I booked a  leftover seat that nicely aligned to my visit date.

Menu (Oct-24):

Otsumami: kamasu, katsuo, shirakawa, hamo, ankimo, itoyoridai,matsutake chawanmushi.

1730580216.0,"Vinho (*) - Seoul, South Korea","My first visit to a Michelin starred restaurant in South Korea. I found this place through social media actually as they recently received their first star only a few months ago, after only being just over 2 years old. All the ingredients are sourced from South Korea (aside from the Lamb option) which is impressive. Often there was a bit of a language barrier with English however most dishes I was able to for the most part understand how they were put together and what was in them.

The menu had 10 courses:
1. Oyster, which was essentially oyster ice cream
2. Scallop, lovely plated scallops
3. Jack Mackerel, steamed within the leaf
4. Eggplant, black fried eggplant, filled with prawn, and covered in sauce made from the same eggplant skin
5. Quail, deliciously plated with ginseng broth
6. Normally this is eel however due to a dietary restriction I received abalones instead
7. Seasonal fish which in this case was butterfish with a green chilli sauce - my favourite main dish
8. Duck, a perfectly cooked piece of duck, very straightforward, with coconut oil massaged into the skin
9. Sujeonggwa, an exquisite desert of ice cream and the famous Korean drink, possibly one of my favourites of all time so far.
10. Soy sauce, soy sauce icecream with a pate of some sort.

I opted for a few individual glasses of wine as I don’t drink much and the wines I tried were great. The host and sommelier was very pleasant and could speak great English. I loved the counter design above all else and it felt serious yet easy going. Would happily return.",finedining
1730576141.0,"Sola SOHO, London","I was a bit skeptical going on here but really enjoyed my meal! You can tell they are used to a pre theatre crowd and getting people in and out, but that wasn’t my case so it felt nice and relaxed. I didn’t get a California vibe at all, but everything was definitely refined and delicious! The turbot and grapefruit dessert were my particular favorites. There is a strong vinegar flavor to the start of the meal (or maybe it was just the ambient scent of the restaurant seeping into my nose) but it was gone after the first “act”. 

Special shout out to the sommelier. The wines were priced higher than I wanted to pay (minimum 20pounds, average about 30) as a non-expert wine drinker. He was so kind and found ways to get me some glasses within what I wanted to spend as well as some generous pours to try out. He was very sweet and accommodating!  

Overall, a great experience - great service and very tasty food. I recently wrote for advice on non-pretentious London tasting menus and this place fit the bill. It was certainly upscale but not overly fancy and very accommodating! Great for a pre theatre meal or a meal on its own.

Every dish was good, I was a bit worried about two granitas (I don’t particularly care for them in general) but that habanero dessert was awesome! A bit of an overuse of truffle for me, but I guess it’s expected from some folks at a place like this. Only dish I had problems with was the mallard. It was SO tough I had to stab it using a full fist with my fork so it wouldn’t slide all over the plate, the skin wasn’t crispy either. Such a shame because the flavors in the dish were fabulous!

It was honestly pretty epic and overall exceeded expectations pretty significantly.  So I thought I'd bring some thoughts.  I'm also posting this under an alt because I know some people who read this forum and I like keeping my primary account private.

My wife has all the pictures so maybe I'll do a more in depth review later with those.

Oriole.  Smyth.  Ever.  Alinea.

One note:  I tend to not take price into account very heavily when reviewing these places.  If you do factor in price a bit that could definitely make a difference.  I want to be wowed.   The Smyth bill was almost twice the Ever bill for example.  Way I figure it is if you are eating at any of these you don't care that much if something was $400 or $600.  OK now that that is out of the way...

Food:

1) Oriole was our favorite food-wise.  Everything they brought out was stunning, delicious and fun.  Perfect execution.  Even comparing somewhat similar dishes here to the other three (the wagyu here to the wagyu at Ever for example.  ) I'd want the Oriole version 10 times out of 10.  This is the one I'm running back to for a second meal as well.

2) I see very polarizing reviews of Smyth so I was pretty eager to try it.  On the night we went I really enjoyed the menu.  The caviar course was quite unique and unconventional but I actually thought it worked.  The lamb course was one of the best courses of the week.  We went in with a bit lowered expectations here and ended up deciding the food at Smyth was second best of the four.  The menu is highly creative and often unconventional, which I loved.   I saw one recent review that said there was ""kelp on everything"".  We had I think one dish with some kelp in it, if it were on everything that might have changed my opinions.

3) Ever came in third.  Utterly stunning restaurant and the plates coming out of the kitchen were beautifully presented and very classic fine dining menu and plating.  But the food just wasn't as good as Smyth/Oriole.  More than one plate came out looking absolutely fantastic but fell a little flat on the flavors and were frankly a touch boring.   I do not want to give a poor impression of Ever however I really enjoyed the meal, it was just clearly third.

4)  Alinea had been a bucket list restaurant for awhile.  And it was such a fun meal.  The presentation and theatrics alone were worth the price of admission.  But this is the only meal were there were courses I just wasn't that impressed with.  I do think they prioritize theatrics over taste a bit.

Thoughts on Wine Pairings:

First off all four pairing were good imo.  But Smyth and Alinea stood out.

1. Smyth.  They had a super creative and awesome wine pairing that was head and shoulders above the other three.  Multiple very fun pairings and they poured some \*very\* good wines.   I'm very into wine personally and had some great discussions with them and they brought out a couple of extra additional pours just for us to try at no cost.
2. Alinea.  Alinea's pairing was also pretty creative and definitely came in second.
3. Oriole.  Honestly an excellent pairing, just through the two above it were exceptionally good.
4. Ever.  This will be the one time I take price into account.  Ever had only one wine pairing level.  The other three had multiple.  Ever's wine pairing is far cheaper and *for the price* was actually pretty great.

Service:

Honestly I have very few complaints about service.  It was very good across the board.   I do feel like Smyth wins the award here overall just because they noticed multiple small things with zero prompting and addressed them quickly.   Like noticing I was left handed and changing how silverware was put on the table.

Oriole was also in contention for the top spot, I felt the service here was just super warm and inviting and friendly and I absolutely loved it.

Overall Rankings and thoughts:

1. Oriole.  My favorite of the four and the first one I'd go back to.  They didn't miss on anything.  The best food.  Great wine pairing.  Flawless and friendly service.  Very fun space (I love the mural on the kitchen ceiling and the elevator you walk through at the entrance).    We not only put this first but we ranked the overall meal here pretty high on our list of Michelin stars we have been to.
2. Smyth.  I get it's polarizing but for me they knocked it out of the park.   If you are going to splurge on a higher end wine pairing do it here.  Very creative.  Excellent service and incredible attention to detail.  I'd love to come back here and try a different menu.
3. Ever.  Stunning restaurant, more classical menu.  Very elegant, classy and beautiful plating.  Very nice evening I just enjoyed the other two more.  I think if I had come here not having just gone to the top two I might think a little higher of it.
4. Alinea.  Second best wine pairing.  The theatrics and presentations and creativity of some of the dishes was really fun.  Service was very good.  But they missed on taste on multiple courses.   So if you haven't been I'd say go.  It's a fun experience.  But I'd go back to the other three and not here.  I experienced it once, I don't need to do so again.  It's a bit more about the experience than the food.",finedining

I'm planning a solo trip to Berlin and Munich in December. I have booking at Tulus Lotrek but I'm considering Tim Raue instead, specifically for the Kolibri/Berlin menu. The Kolibri menu sounds like elevated German comfort food. Since it'll be my first time in Germany, the menu sounded interesting. I would prefer to try something I wouldn't be able to have elsewhere and other restaurants seem like restaurants I could find in the US (I live in the San Francisco Bay Area).

It seems like people on this forum have had mixed reviews but I believe this was mainly for the Asian-influenced menu. Has anyone tried the Kolibri menu at Tim Raue? Anything other restaurants that are doing something similar (German food elevated)?

Thanks!

Snapper. 8/10. Loved the fresh start the shiso oil, lime and apple combo really worked.
Veal tartare. 8/10. Lovely. The brussel sprout shavings were an excellent combo!
Cod with miso and bacon. 10/10. Felt like a carbonara sauce iirc? I just remember that this was a really good course, with both a heavy savory bacon/carbonara style component balancing with the sweetness of the cod.
Ravioli with squash, sage and lemongrass. 10/10. To die for. 
Scallop with coffee, matsutake, foie gras. 8/10. Solid course. 
Beef. 8/10. Amazing, just wished I had a tad bit more of the beef!

1730365992.0,Takayama (*) in Kyoto,"I had dinner at Takayama as a solo diner on October 20th and I already knew about the massive amounts of food they serve so I skipped lunch and only had a small breakfast that day. I was still not fully prepared for the amount of food and was just barely able to finish my meal. I guess they want to give you a taste of everything which is why they have courses for meat, fish, pasta, and risotto as well as multiple appetizer courses.

The quality was excellent throughout the entire meal and the wine pairing was pretty good too. Highlights were the risotto and some of the appetizers.

Service was attentive and friendly. The meal finishes in a little over two hours so there isn’t a lot of downtime. They do ask you questions about your visit to Japan, where you’re coming from, and what kind of food/wine you like which some people might find annoying, but I didn’t mind it.

Dinner costs ¥28,000 and the wine pairing is another ¥14,000 which I think is appropriately priced. I wouldn’t say it’s a must visit in Kyoto, but it could be a nice change compared to the mostly traditional Japanese restaurants one might generally visit in that area.",finedining

And I appreciated the creativity and thought put into the dishes more than the taste. If you can get a seat facing the window you get a terrific view. Kwonsookso kinda disappointed me. Love Jungsik both in Seoul and NY but it's more French influenced. My current US favorite is Bom in NYC but I haven't been to Atomix yet.

What are all of your favorite fine dining Korean restaurants? Any city. I prefer those that do a better job of maintaining Korean flavors and dishes.

1730325996.0,What to expect from Noma Taste Buds,"Posting this to try and save you some frustration.

My wife and brothers got me the Noma tastebuds thing for 2024, which was an incredibly thoughtful gift. I'm definitely in ""the target audience"" (disposable income, not in culinary industry, cooking as hobby, gets a little too into hobbies). I felt way too exposed watching The Menu. Anyway.

I live in Copenhagen, so their idea was that they would be getting me access to some in experiences that would be inspiring and similar. Unfortunately, what they didn't realize is that the experiences weren't the product, and those experiences are behind a raffle anyway. Only two took place afaik — foraging in NYC and in CPH. Wasn't selected in the raffle, and no wait list either for no-shows. They ended up posting some videos on the discord on how to cook with these things, and they did one live discord event in June.

You get 4 boxes over the course of the year, each one with 3-4 items in bottles b/w 50 and 250ml.

Box 1: Barley Koji Oil, Beef Garum, Pumpkin Seed Praline

Box 2: Pepper Tamari, Kyoto Secret Peaso, Rose Kombucha (2x), Noma Dashi

Box 3: BBQ Sauce, Spice Mix, Noma Coffee

Box 4: TBD

In the first box, they sent some merch: an embossed moleskine and a canvas bag.

In Danish kroner, each box is essentially 1000kr, so $150ish USD. Most recently, the coffee was a 100g bag, so hat was a $50 bag of coffee, so 50c per gram.

The discord itself is pretty dead. It started off relatively active as I think folk were excited, and around the summer things have thinned out.

And that's it.

Maybe they will learn and evolve the experience for 2025. But I feel like I am likely replaying a lot of the same feedback I saw from 2023.

If you want the noma experience, go to Noma and have the entire staff jump you when you open the door, or to one of the countless experiences that their alumni have created. Buy their individual products, because theose products are solid and you're getting what you want. 

But don't waste your money on Taste Buds.",finedining

1730256677.0,"Mabel Gray, Hazel Park, MI 10.2 mo 9.24","My wife and I celebrated our first wedding anniversary, a little belated, at Mabel Grey in Hazel Park, MI (a suburb of Detroit).
We each ordered the tasting menu with the drink pairings. To say we were delighted would be an understatement. 
Mabel Gray is not a Michelin-starred restaurant, and you don’t need to dress to the nines to feel at home there. But their food is phenomenal, the service is impeccable, and the overall experience was incredibly memorable.

Speaking of memorable…I’m doing this part from memory, part from my photos, and part from the menu descriptions (which help, but not everything was on the menu!):
We started with an oyster course (one raw and one cooked, with scallion and their house chili crunch and cider mignonette, among other fall flavors). Both were briny and oyster-y, but they were different enough to each be unique and interesting.

Then came the roasted beet salad, with farro, ricotta salata, macerated raspberry, balsamic, lemon yogurt and olive oil. This was earthy from the beet, but bright from the acidity of the lemon and yogurt and other acidy components (nice mix of sweet and sour). The ricotta was creamy enough to balance it out well. I think it might yet benefit from some toasted nuts for additional crunch (Hazelnuts? Walnuts?) But overall, just fantastic.

The SOUP. Tomato/potato puree, with celery and crab salad, ciabatta crouton, herbed ricotta, and black garlic oil. This soup was delicious, and the garnish was additive (and didn’t distract from the star of the show). Also impressive was that it was served at the exact right temp…not too hot to melt your face, but not just lukewarm. It was a really perfect soup dish.

Next was a salmon starter with Everything Bagel spice, some herbs, tomato, gastriq…
(As you can tell from the lack of specifics, this one wasn’t written out on the menu). Perfectly cooked salmon that was buttery and warm. The spice mix was nice and not overpowering. The herbs and oil were just right.

Wild Boar “Sloppy Joe” with pickled jalapeños and avocado mousse, on tostada, with fried quail egg on top. This was fun a warm and delicious and REALLY paired nicely with their well-balanced Prickly Pear Margarita. Elevated bar food; really hit the spot on a gloomy Fall evening.

Coconut Sorbet palate cleanser. The little saucers were ADORABLE.

Bison filet with acorn squash puree, onion streusel, scallion and Lord knows what else (also not written on the menu, obviously). This was my wife’s overall favorite and deservedly so. Perfectly seasoned and cooked, with really nice textural differences and a balance between salty/savory/sweet. An excellent entree dish.

Dessert (with candles because of our anniversary): Carmel cake with caramel and nuts and some sort of whipped cream business and fried sage and cranberry compote…a perfect end to a wonderful meal. Not OVERLY sweet but just sweet enough, with a nice bright contrast with the cranberries. The sage gave it a warm hug of Fall.

We loved everything about this meal, and we’ll be back here again in the not-too-distant future. I hope we make the cut for this sub. :)",finedining
1730247347.0,"Âme, Barcelona (Michelin recommendation)","Upon request from this sub, I‘m happily reporting back from our dinner at Âme tonight. This intimate little restaurant (~20 seats) opened early this year, and already has a Michelin recommendation. 

It was our third dinner there, and there are many reasons why we keep coming back. One of the things that impressed us the most is the sequence of flavours throughout the menu. Creating one perfect dish, or 10 or 20 perfect dishes, that is something many chefs achieve over the years of practice. But creating a dozen dishes that really work beautifully together in a tasting menu, each dish complementing the one before and the one after, in a menu that makes perfect sense from the first to the last dish, well, in our opinion, Âme does this exceptionally well. We ate at restaurants with one or more Michelin stars that were nowhere near that level, regarding the progression of flavours throughout the courses. 

Something else that struck us is the mood and spirit in the kitchen. Pachi, the chef, told us once that he wants to have fun at work, and cook in a peaceful environment, and this is exactly the atmosphere that radiates from the kitchen. The chef, his business partner Joey and the two other guys working in the kitchen, form a perfectly harmonic team, serving the most amazing food. Just imagine dishes straight from ""The Bear"", but with Ted Lasso as chef de cuisine. And noRoy Kent (as much as I loved the character).

Now, for the food. Âme‘s cuisine makes use of local Mediterranean products, mostly seafood, leaning towards French cuisine, with some Japanese influence. 

The tasting menu starts with a wonderful triptych of a mushroom consommé (which has recently replaced the mushroom flan), a pil-pil of red prawns and an amazing bluefin tartar. It‘s a powerful and very tasty start, but leaving room for a lot of progression. 

Next comes Maitake, a mushroom which grows on chestnut trees, grilled so it has crispy edges, and served on a cream of foie and cashews. Amazingly earthy taste, yet so refined. 

Following are scallops on a beurre noisette, with a citric mollusc foam. Also a strong dish. 

After that, Hamachi (briefly cured), on a sauce vierge with Yuzu. Between this dish and the next, I‘m having a hard time thinking of a better fish course I‘ve eaten in many many years. 

The menu goes on with trout on a beurre blanc with trout roe, with herbs and fig oil. A fantastic fish course. 

The meat course is Iberian pork ""pluma"", a very precious part of a muscle that gained the name ""secreto"", because butchers were keen on keeping that part for themselves, the meat is so precious and tasty. 

After this, you may (and must, if available!) choose to add the rice dish with red prawns, which is extremely flavourful. 

Afterwards, the chefs serve a wonderful little cheese platter. The (not that) secret stars of this dish are the foie with kombu and a homemade bone marrow butter which I can only describe as highly addictive. 

Finally it is time for the first dessert: a strawberry sorbet with champagne foam, a perfect palate cleanser, and a very nice pre-dessert. 

And last, a pudding made of dates, salted caramel butter and tonka beans. I‘m always happy to decline if anyone offers me dates. They are really not my thing. But this dessert takes the best of them, and turns it into a wonderful little cake, with a hint of dates. 

If you made it to the end of my enthusiastic (and probably rather lengthy) review, you will understand why I strongly recommend Âme to every visitor or resident of Barcelona who is into fine dining. Such a quality, such a personal experience, with a chef who is very happy to come to the table and discuss the dishes with you, and all this for a (as of yet) ridiculously low price.

NOMA creating dishes and using ingredients and techniques that people hadn't seen before, everyone was copying them and they started a whole new movement for restaurants to follow. IMO the parallels with El Bulli are clear.

Courses:
1) corn soup, and fritter, caviar. 6/10. Loved the soup. Very fresh and flavorful. Did not really care too much about the fritter or the caviar.
2) raw steelhead trout with tomato basil foam. 5/10? Was okay. Largely unmemorable. 5/10.
3) octopus skewer. Succulent octopus. Didn’t really have any charcoal notes. But the aioli had a very Indian red chilli pickle kind of taste which I really liked. 6/10.
4) halibut in Jiri consommé. Loved the broth. Had a beautiful depth of flavor and heat to it. Fish was cooked reasonably well. First course in this meal that made me happy. 7/10.
5) Iberico flank steak, lettuce, pickles. 5/10. Rather have this at a Korean bbq. Nothing special whatsoever. Overriding red chili and vinegar flavors.
6) Wagyu with Tabbouleh. 5/10. Reasonably cooked wagyu. kept wishing there was a nice sauce. Tabbouleh didn’t make sense to me with the meat.
7) Bibimbap. 8/10. Only really happy meal. Beautifully balanced. Loved it.

This is a relatively new restraunt in the UK, so hasn't gathered much of a reputation as of it, but it managed to combine a friendly Northern vibe with my best fine dining experience so far.

Particularly interesting for me was the no-alchohol wine pairing - the restraunt offered an alchohol free pairing, that was served when others on my table had wine.the lengths they went through to explain the in-house no-alchohol pairings (top right on the menu) blew my mind with how it complemented the dishes .

1730140268.0,"Disfrutar (Barcelona, ***)","

Just came back from lunch at Disfrutar. Needless to say, we had the highest expectations, since it is not only a three-star restaurant, but also took first place this year of The World‘s 50 Best Restaurants (although that list has let us down severely in the past). 
But what fired up our expectations the most is that because we live in Barcelona since autumn 2022, we know how incredibly good and inventive many of the restaurants here are, even those with ""just"" a Michelin recommendation, like Direkte Boquería, Besta, Âme and so on…

I will not describe every single dish now, since that would take fifteen pages, but I want to clearly state that all our expectations have been met, and exceeded. It was a fantastic lunch. 

What struck us the most:
In many fine dining places, they throw all the expensive ingredients at you, truffles, caviar, oysters, wagyu, tuna belly, the list goes on. 
At Disfrutar, what these chefs are doing with simple ingredients like tomatoes or mushrooms, is out of this world. 

A few words on the most outstanding dishes (although, again, almost every course was fantastic):

Gazpacho Sandwich with scented vinegar garnish: A tomato sorbet, in between two slices of tomato merengues. Before you take a bite, you inhale the vinegar scent from a cognac glass. It is very hard to elevate the essence of tomatoes any further…

The four mushroom courses were absolutely brilliant. The first one, Crunchy Mushroom Leaf, was made from boletus broth and rice flour, creating a cookie with magnificent boletus taste. 

Flavor concentration: Sprouts. 11 different sprouts, to be tasted with tweezers, on a tomato gel, to be spooned up in between the sprouts, as a palate cleanser. We felt educated, but not in a highbrow or condescending way. This was like taking your four year old daughter to the zoo, so she could touch a rabbit‘s fur, a goat‘s horn, a lamb‘s wool. Or, as my wife put it, this dish was ""like a petting zoo for your tongue“.
It really lets you appreciate the defining flavour of every single sprout, in a very fun way. 

Macaroni alla Carbonara: Disfrutar‘s Carbonara version, with flourless pasta made of Iberian pork broth, solidified into a gel. And a foam of egg sauce on top. Plus crispy guanciale, freshly ground pepper, freshly ground parmesan. So, very technical (the pasta part), but at the same time the soul of Carbonara was perfectly preserved. You could feed this to an Italian child (used to their grandmother‘s fresh pasta), and the kid would say: sure, this is perfect Carbonara, only the noodles are a bit strange. 

Musing on walnuts: they did make the whole walnut edible, by fermenting the thick green outer skin, and by (separately) putting the walnut into sugared water for weeks. Experimental, but not for the sake of experimenting. The result was impressive, and obviously something we had never eaten before. 

Hoisin cucumber: A combination of cucumber sorbet, mint sorbet, crispy pork skin, cheese cream, hoisin sauce and mint crackers. Certainly one of the most creative and by far best desserts I have eaten in my life. 

So, as I said, not a single dish was below extraordinary. Disfrutar was absolutely fantastic, and clearly the highlight of our culinary year 2024. ",finedining
1730139214.0,Gion Nishikawa (**) in Kyoto on October 23rd,"This was one of my favorite restaurants I visited in Japan. Kaiseki cuisine often gets called underseasoned because it’s primarily about the natural taste of the ingredients, but I didn’t think think it lacked seasoning. Sure, these ingredients would be cooked in a very different way in a western restaurant, but I don’t think that means this approach is at all inferior.

 Standout dishes were the mushroom tempura (although the sauce makes it look a bit gross), the grilled lobster with miso sauce (no idea why the menu says brain sauce), and the sushi which is eaten like a sando with the sea weed. Product quality was excellent throughout the menu, and the only disappointing dish was the soup with Kyoto beef because it was overcooked. No idea why they decided to add that ingredient to the soup.

I was the only foreigner in the restaurant which felt a little weird initially, but I was able to use my limited Japanese to make some small talk with some of the other guests. I would absolutely recommend people visit this restaurant if they can get a reservation as it is a stellar way to experience traditional Japanese cuisine. Total cost including a nihonshu/sake pairing was around ¥50,000 and the amount of food was just about right. ",finedining

Yoroniku Tokyo was one of our first stops.  We decided to try this branch since it is brand new. We snagged a booking through Vanne san (nicest guy).  Each table is in its own private room.  

The omakase couse has all of the signature Yoroniku dishes.  It is a lot of food so be warned (they asked us at the start if we wanted smaller portions - it is roughly 350g of meat per person).

I personally believe we are looking for monoliths of the industry that have left a legacy behind that shapes the scope of what fine dining is today, even years past their closure, e.g. El Bulli, noma, etc. St John in London comes to mind, too, because of their nose to tail cooking approach, that is becoming ever so popular with the shift to zero waste cooking.

1730125885.0,3-star restaurants in Europe with a non-alcoholic drink pairing?,"Hi everyone,

first time poster and I come to you directly with a question:

I want to propose to my girlfriend in spring next year and since we are both in love with fine-dining I would love to combine that with our first 3-Michelin star restaurant visit ever.

But here is the thing: She can't drink alcohol! I love wine and she is okay with me getting the wine pairings, but I find it awkward to get drunk on great wines while she gets to sip on two or three standard drinks that we either have in our cellar ourselves (Muri, Van Nahmen Sparkling Tea, Geiger e.g.) or two or three mocktails that were thrown together and match the food more or less.

So far we had three stellar experiences when it came to non-alcoholic drink pairings:

* La Degustation Bohême Bourgeoise, Prague, 1-star: The food was good, but not mind-blowing. The wine pairing was also mediocre, but the non-alcoholic drink pairing alongside the menu was a revelation and leaps and bounds better than my wine pairing
* tulus lotrek, Berlin, 1-star: Excellent food, solid wine pairing, excellent non-alcoholic drink pairing alongside the menu
* Il Palagio, Florence, 1-star: Very good food, excellent wine pairings, no non-alcoholic drink pairing offered, but the Sommelier gave the task to the barkeeper of the bar of the Four Seasons and he came up with fabulous mocktails the whole evening

Now my question is: Are there any other great, preferably 3-star restaurants (but 3-star is not a must!) in Europe that offer non-alcohic drink pairings? I tried to look some up myself, but it is sometimes hard to even figure out their wine pairings, let alone other drinks. Should I stick to restaurants associated to hotels as they have barkeepers up to the task available? Any help would be appreciated!",finedining
1730125677.0,L'Effervescence (***) How is this still 3 star?,"Maybe I was spoiled because I had just gone to Alinea 2 days before and then I went to Hajime 2 weeks later but this place was not even close to the level of the other 2.  

https://imgur.com/GR5OEoK

We opted for the non-alcoholic paring and while the food was skillful and some of it interesting, I felt the Non-Alcoholic Paring was a bad choice.  Drinks were attempts at recreation of wine instead of a decision to match a non-alcoholic drink with the dish.   This left for some really terrible matches and one that I felt like tasted like window cleaner.  

I took very few photos here so I will leave those to the other posts, but my main gripe here isn't the food itself but with Alinea and Hajime I would say easily almost every dish was perfect, at L'efferescence I can easily say my favorite was the Ravioli because so many others were fine or ok.  They did not rise to the level of flavor and invention that I am looking for at this level.  I do like my food edgy though, playful, adventurous.   L'E just didn't seem to do it for me.

Quick Highs: The Duck and the Duck.  The Salad.  The Chips. 
The Lows: The Turnip, the sea urchin, the cheese.

But really the issue is the touches.  There was spilled food near my silverware for almost the whole meal.  No one came to take it away.  

The portion sizes were absurd.  This was a 13 dish meal.  I was given a full turnip, the size of a racquetball.   I was given 4-5 oz of pomfret.   I was given a giant bowl of Matcha, not a cup, a bowl.  I have seen other photos and I was not given the amount of Matcha they were given.  I got over 8 oz of Matcha, it was comically large, we made jokes about it later in the trip. Oh would you like a gallon of Matcha after your 13 course meal?   They presented 2 full rolls of bread to each person at the table. 
 There was way too much food that I had to leave plates unfinished which makes me feel like I am not liking the food, which makes me feel uncomfortable.  I liked the food enough to enjoy it but I still had to leave things.   This is not something I should have to feel at this level. 

I went to the bathroom and when I returned the next dish was there and the explanation I got was from someone passing by and said ""This is the pear dessert.""   

There was an air of mild chaos around the dining room, a bit of rushing and a bit of feeling maybe they were short staffed.  Nothing glaring, but it was not a dance, it was not timed well and it along with everything else just left me with the feeling that this place should not be 3*.  There were far too many complaints for me to recommend L'Effervescence.",finedining
1730110401.0,"Sazenka in Tokyo (3*, Tabelog 4.53 Gold) ","Recent visit to Sazenka for the seasonal Shanghai Crab menu. Snagged a cancellation in mid August through Tablecheck.

Food here is generally delicate and extremely well-calibrated, as a reflection of the chef’s philosophy (Chinese food executed with Japanese sensibilities) and washoku background from training at Ryugin. You can clearly identify and taste the flavors that are layered upon each dish, but not in a way that leaves you wanting more complexity. One other thing I appreciated is that the hot dishes were all served piping hot, but just under the temp where you’d genuinely burn your mouth eating it.

Servers were all incredibly knowledgeable regarding the dishes and happy to answer questions, but it felt a bit too mechanical and white tablecloth at times. We were seated close to the kitchen, so we often heard the team whispering things like “Guest from X table has left their seat” and “(Dish) for X table will be out in X minutes”. There was also a slight mix-up where we were served a pot of tea we didn’t order and we just assumed it was part of the menu since no one said anything until a server apologized to us during dessert. While there were no major missteps per se, as someone who prefers a more homey and casual atmosphere it was a bit stuffy for me. 

Highlights included:

Drunken Crab - The female crab was especially luscious and decadent. One of those dishes where you’re just nodding to yourself in appreciation.

Steamed Crab - A mix of both the female and male crabs to create varied textures and flavors throughout different layers of the dish. Paired with black vinegar that just brings the dish to the next level with the bit of added complexity and acidity. 

Kessennuma Shark Fin and Shanghai Crab “Risotto” with White Truffle - Rice mixed into the sauce from the previous fukahire dish and then topped with white truffle. Just goes perfectly with the white truffle aroma.

Turnip Cake - I grew up eating this often, so having such a humble dish elevated in the most simple way possible really resonated with me. It had an incredible sweetness, and the yuzu paired with it added a nice perfume and freshness to the dish. Pure ingredient quality and technique.

Un Pai Rou (Sliced Pork with Eggplant) - Paired with an in-house sweet soy sauce and to be eaten a few slices at a time on top of rice. Probably my favorite dish of the night.

Mapo Tofu - Optional add-on to be served after the main course. The same precision in seasoning and spice that’s ever-present throughout the menu. The best mapo tofu I’ve ever had, and just super comforting to wolf it down with rice at the end of the meal.

In terms of food alone, probably the best Chinese meal I’ve ever had. As mentioned above though, there were a few aspects of the service that could be improved on. While I wouldn’t turn down a chance to revisit, with a steep price point (72k for this menu, ~50k for the regular menu) and the sheer number of incredible restaurants in Japan, I probably won’t be going back anytime soon.

1730101778.0,De Nieuwe Winkel (** Nijmegen),"I had the chance to book the unbookable and we traveled to Nijmegen to try arguably the best plant based restaurant worldwide(nr 1. we're smart guide). DNW is botanical gastronomy and they have several food forrest and garden in the area but they also import products. 

The atmosphere is really relaxed, hardly anyone is in suit but the servers are very friendly and professional. The restaurant works partly with an open kitchen but except for their yell every 40 min or so the open kitchen is hardly a distraction and a pleasure to watch.

On to the food!

1. before ordering we started with a carrotsoup with an intense flavor, to our surprise the waiter tells us they only add rose oil, nothing else. Great beginning.
2. Almond soup
This is my favoriete dish they present pure quality ingredients full of taste, some you immediately recognize (fennel/dill) some you don't. With every ingrediënt you grab a layer of the thick 'soup' made from black almond and tomato. This is such a clever dish because every bite is different and interesting. A lot of umami flavor in the soup and very tasty ingredients.  Strong start!
3.  Empanada filled with cantharells carrotsausage(whatever that means) and Feta cheese made from nuts. This very good but a little dry.
4. Cauliflower and pate, Very rich dish with strong tastes coming from the flowers and a very 'meaty' pate. Great combination.
5. Seasoup, one of the highlights of the evening! This was made entirely of micro and macro algea. A lot of different and unique tastes here and there was one piece that was gimy like bord meat or thick fish. I will never forget this dish.
6. Yuba, egg plant, miso and coffeeshoyu. Another highlight strong soy taste and umami flavors. Very interesting complex dish.
7. Red and black onion, bouillon made from Chinese mahagony wood. With all these full dishes this dish is not too complex but it really fits the flow.
8. Beet, bbq sauce with berries and cherries. This was fine, I did not like it very much. The berries and cherries further enhance the beet taste that is a little boring to me, the wine pairing saved this somewhat. 
9. Cheese, this one was optional but I had heard good things about the vegan cheese. Unfortunately eveybody agreed that this was a huge let down. There was just very little taste in any of the cheeses. Even when compared to other vegan cheeses this was not really exceptionnal (for Dutch people interested in vegan cheese, try vannu. restaurant is overrated and overpriced imo but their cheese is fantastic)
10. The first dessert was maïs amazake. This is not for everyone I was Lucky enough to have a tablet guest geving their dish to me. I really loved it. It is really tought to pull of an excellent sweet-savory dessert but they really did it. A lot of interesting flavors and complex bites. Some ingredients were Mexican Tomatillo and mole(not sure what it means)
11. Nougat, The final dish was more of a classic dessert a seperared nougat with hazelnuttempeh and hazelnutyoghurt very good!

The drink pairing was very interesting as they mixed special drinks with excellent wines.

I really recommend DNW to anyone, vegan or not, to check this out I had a great time.",finedining

I might also make posts for my other fine dining experiences (L’Effervescence, Takayama, Gion Nishikawa, and Yakitori Ichimatsu) if I have the time.

Overall, this was a very good sushi dinner, but I don’t think the quality was much better than the Michelin starred sushi I’ve had in the west. At ¥44,000, it’s quite a pricey omakase, but they’re really going out of their way to give you all of the most expensive ingredients you can expect. Uni, caviar, abalone, different cuts of tuna, chawanmushi with matsutake, among others.

They make a lot of side dishes so it’s not all nigiri (there might have been more nigiri that I didn’t photograph, but I am not sure) which you may enjoy or not. A surprising standout piece was the tamago at the end which I’ve never had as good before, but I also loved the uni and the fatty tuna. The dinner took less than two hours and it was the perfect amount of food for me.

I sat next to a Japanese couple and we made some pleasant small talk. The rest of the restaurant was filled with a Chinese tourist group who mostly kept to themselves. I definitely did not feel like I was treated differently as a western tourist, but speaking a little Japanese might have helped. I probably wouldn’t return, but I still had a good time.",finedining

1729998931.0,"Sushi Namba Hibiya (Tabelog 4.55, Gold) ","Seated in the hanare (private counter) for the foreigner seating booked through TableAll. 

Otsumami are served by his apprentices first while Namba-san finishes up the earlier seating, and then he moves to the hanare to start the nigiri portion after. The room only seats four people so it actually feels quite intimate since you practically get full access to Nanba-san once the he starts with the nigiri.

Atmosphere was very calm and serene. You do get that quintessential “high-end sushiya” vibe in the sense that it’s quite hushed, but it wasn’t stuffy at all. Namba-san is generally soft-spoken so I assume this is just the vibe he prefers and that this is the case for the main counter as well. 

The other party with us was incredible; they were just as thrilled to be there as we were. I was the only Japanese-speaking guest this time so I took care of interpreting for the table. Namba-san barely speaks any English, so I’d personally say you do need some level of Japanese if you really want his insight on all the items served and their individual characteristics. He also mentioned that the Miami branch will probably be delayed a bit more and that he recommends Sushi Sho and Yoshino as his picks for NYC.

Drinks were comped as thanks for interpreting for the table (nothing expensive, but still very much appreciated) and we were offered a shako nigiri as an add-on at the end of the course, which the kind couple we shared the seating with offered to pay for as thanks (thank you!)

Nigiri is listed in menu with an unlisted dish of Matsutake and Zuwaigani (Snow Crab) with shari as well as the add-on shako.

Highlights included
1. Botan ebi - Superb texture and flavor amplified by a paste of ebi-miso and crushed up shells mixed into a paste.

2. Ankimo - Pure sweetness with zero funk. Literally as silky as tofu.

3. Maguro sequence - Started with a temaki, followed by setoro, and then ootoro. Namba-san kept talking about how good today’s tuna was (Oma) and it definitely didn’t disappoint. He said it was worth flying across the world for and our seatmates (from New York) agreed.

4. Shiro-ika - Extremely thinly sliced strips layered. Very good sweetness from the squid as well as really nice texture.

5. Matsutake with Zuwaigani and Shari - Really fun dish with great perfume from the matsutake (Iwate)  and a nice accent from the crab meat.

Overall, incredible meal from start to finish. Tsumami was definitely stronger but his nigiri is no slouch either. Didn’t get any sense that we were being treated differently due to being foreigners either. He seemed quite happy to be able to communicate his thoughts to foreigners in more details.

I didn't fully understand the cuisine we were walking into, but it turned out to be Asian inspired, Californian cuisine. Lots of Asian ingredients (water kimchi, tofu, sake ice cream), but all super fresh locally sourced, with a emphasis on seafood.

Some highlights:

* The opening starter was a soft tofu with a fish reduction and uni. Flavors were wonderful; uni was super fresh, and balanced with the salty umami fish reduction really well.
* The mini hotdog in brioche with peanut sauce was great. Reminded me of Hong Shao Rou flavors!
* The smoked mussel, green garlic potage was warming and very rich. Came with the bread, so the bread was a perfect way to mop everything up.
* The passion fruit dessert was amazing. The mildly crispy top played off the airy passion fruit cream well.

Overall, super super nice and wonderful people making some wonderful unpretentious food. Please give them a try!

1729973738.0,"Under Lindesnes - 1* in Båly, Norway","Dining 5m under the sea might seem like a gimmick, but this restaurant definitely was more than that. I actually thought I was going to get distracted by the fish all night and wouldn't be able to pay attention to the food, but it was actually the other way around. Service was better than some of the 2 star places I've been to, with a special shoutout to the Front of House dude who was so so cool. They even had names for a lot of the fish that visited them! Also learned a ton about sustainable practices in winemaking which was really nice.

The menu was mostly seafood. The standouts for me:
-- Second course, an ""edible shell"" which was like a deconstructed oyster
-- Langoustine with cauliflower emulsion and butter sauce. It was perfectly cooked and so simple and delicious. Friends, I cried.
-- The roasted carrot dish with its wine pairing was perfectly balanced.
-- The pairings were so well thought out. Every wine complimented every dish perfectly in a very playful way.

The only dish I unfortunately didn't enjoy as much was the main, which was monkfish with sautéed kale. It was a bit too salty altogether, even though all the individual components were perfectly cooked. I have to say they probably need to fix this before they could aim for a second star.

All in all, an amazing experience and I don't say this about all the star places I've been to: I would probably go again.",finedining

1729949018.0,Spring in Marietta Ga,"We love this little restaurant located outside Atlanta in Marietta.

Been going here for years and is where I proposed to my wife and last night we celebrated our 2 year wedding anniversary here.

The menu is always really simple and small and I've yet to have a bad dish. They have maybe 10-15 tables so it's quite intimate but not crowded. I always tell people to try this place out if they are looking to get into ""fine dining"" because it's always good and they don't try to be really crazy, outside of the box and its not intimidating at all. I think it's a great gateway drug to show people how food can be exciting, delicious and artful.

- Blue Fin Crudo (Myself)
They have always had a crudo dish on the menu and this one was good. Refreshing and bright. Had to avoid some of those big pieces of basil because other got a little powerful at time but overall was very delicious.

- Lamb Tartar (Wife)
Nice portion size and but was hiden under the veggies. Great flavor with a little bit of heat at the end. First bite was slightly difficult due to the length of the julienne veggies but when cut in half...perfect.

- Chicken Liver and Foie Gras (Myself)
Some of my favorite Foie dishes have been from Spring. This was a new version and god dam , it was the star of the night. Great portion size a d holy hell, I couldn't get enough of it. The plum jelly  and pistachio puree took it over the top. She tried a bite of my Foie dish and her eyes rolled into the back of her head. I HIGHLY recommend trying the Foie if you ever come here. (A+)

- Chicory Salad (Wife)
Very fresh and crisp. Massive portion and my wife really enjoyed it. Cheese was very clean and of great quality. Her only critique was that the pieces of letlettuce were very large to get a comfortable bite with put having to make little wraps to spear on to her fork. 

- Cappelletti (Myself)
I normally don't order pasta/ravioli dishes dishes but asking the waiter what her like more between the Halibut and Cappelletti, he led me to the Cappelletti and I was not disappointed. This thing was HEAVY, RICH, CREAMY and FLAVORFUL. I was hoping to leave stuffed and at the end, mission accomplished. The mushrooms were a perfect and the thinly sliced pecorino melted in your mouth. Very impressed and was happy.

- Crown Roasted Chicken (Wife)
We did not get to taste each other's last dishes due to her having a gluten allergy and my Cappelletti was full of it. She did give me a few of the roasted maitake mushroom that came with this dish and theh tasted like roasted perfection. It came out looking beautifully roasted and there was alot on the plate to try and tackle...but she did it. 

Overall, it was very good and quite filling. We were too stuffed to have a dessert which in our roughly 10 times dining there, we've never done. The desserts we have had from them in the past have all be home runs. 

I highly recommend this place. Service isn't too slow, staff is really cool and the food is awesome. 

It's not the French Laundry or Boulud but I dont think that's what they are going for. It's classic dishes done at a very high and honest humble level. The staff there is killing it and I look forward to what more they can do and will always be coming back. 

They close for a few months early in 2025 for expansion remodel and I hop",finedining

It was tasty but my last fine dining experience before this was Alchemist, and they just had a much better egg.

1729895142.0,Opening cloche by guest?,"This might be a strange question, but as here are many professionals, I have had this question for quite a while. It happened some time ago in a posh restaurant/hotel in this Swiss Alps. We had dinner of three courses with five people. I was 28f at the time, a friend 30m, another friend 32m, the friend’s mother and his uncle, both around 70 years old.
When the main course was served, there were only two waiters, so that there was one hand missing to open the cloches.
One was standing behind the two younger guys, the other one behind the two older people. One of them said to me ""can you please help"" and I had to lift it by myself. I found it strange from the moment on it happened, firstly because I think if you use cloches, you need enough people to lift them and why would you choose a woman at the table to do it? As it was a very traditional restaurant and as a waiter I'd consider to choose one of the younger men to do it?

I was watching an old documentary when I saw this top 10 list for restaurants in the world from 1994. The World 50 Best list only started in 2002, I didn't realize anyone tried to do something similar before then (even the Michelin Guide was Europe-only back then).

It's really interesting to think about how restaurants and tastes have evolved over 30 years. It's not perfect but I have a bit of an old-fashioned taste, so I think I prefer this list to World 50 nowadays (but it's a bit similar to La Liste). I've only been to Hotel de Ville Crissier (formerly Fredy Girardet), Le Louis XV, and Sukiyabashi Jiro on this list, but they were all excellent and among my most memorable meals.

It's funny how Jiro was hyped up even before Michelin, Bourdain, and the movie, but I guess in 1994 none of the current Tabelog Gold sushiyas (or even ""older"" places like Sawada and Harutaka, or Tabelog itself for that matter) existed, so Jiro probably really was king back then.

Here's Patricia's accompanying article. I agree with a lot of her commentary on the importance of locality and respect for local tradition (she was hostile to even neighborly French-Italian fusion at Marchesi which would explain the rusticity of her Italian picks, I wonder what she'd think of a place like Mugaritz lol), although I find her prediction about avoiding globalism and taste homogenization to be a little naïve: [https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/17/IHT-creme-de-la-creme-the-verdict-is-in.html](https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/17/IHT-creme-de-la-creme-the-verdict-is-in.html)

1729588300.0,The Ritz - London. October 2024,"After having seen so much praise of the Ritz on this sub for their excellent food and service, we had to try it, so we went for their 3 course lunch menu for our recent anniversary. 

From the off, service lived up to the hype; every staff member we interacted with in the restaurant greeted us by name and wished us a happy anniversary. 

After we were seated, the amouse was brought out quickly. It consisted of 3 bites (from left to right in the photo): duck liver with cherry gel and gingerbread, coronation chicken tuile, and a Parmesan and basil mousse. All were very good, but the coronation chicken stood out for me - slightly sweet and savoury, with an excellent crunch. 

We both had crab as the first course. It was shredded and bound with a crab mousse, topped with grape jelly. The sauce was some sort of fermented milk(?) but I didn’t catch it exactly. The flavour was good and the jelly and crab had nicely contrasting texture. The sauce was light and didn’t take away from the flavour of the crab. 

My wife had lamb as the main and said it was excellent. Served with potato pave, sweetbread, and onion. I had chicken (not pictured, because I am not much of a photographer and got to it before my wife could get a picture). The chicken itself was well cooked and tasty, but not remarkable. It was plated with a celeriac (a puree and a roasted piece) and foie gras, all of which outshone the chicken. 

We both had the sour cherry soufflé for dessert and agreed it was one of the best desserts we’ve had. Rich and decadent, it tread the line between being too big and perfectly satiating. The sour cherry cut through the sweetness well. 

Finally were petit fours. From left to right: a hazelnut-caramel chocolate (tasted like a posh Ferraro rocher - excellent). A raspberry lime jelly (very refreshing), and a vanilla macaron. 

They also brought us a small cake for our anniversary at this point, but we were both too full to eat it, so they boxed it up for us to take home. 

Total damage: £306 for 2 lunch menus and 2 (of the more modestly priced) glasses of wine each. 

To summarize: although we are not fine dining regulars, this meal ticked all the boxes. The service and ancillary courses were above expectations, and the mains certainly met them. The food was not avant-garde or experimental in any way, but rather classics done very very well. The setting was elegant in the extreme and they have and enforce a fairly strict dress code to maintain that (which we quite like, but I understand this is controversial). ",finedining

Minimalism wasn’t the defining feature of the meal as a course often relied on a number of ingredients, all deftly seasoned and underpinned by harmony.

Seasonal imprints were discernible – for example, a curl of rosy sea bass rested on top of chestnuts and glutinous rice, an ode to harvests. The mellow, miso-filled fig that accompanied the grilled long-tooth grouper was a pleasure to savour. 

The chef’s attention to detail was evident. For instance, kintsuba, a Japanese dessert made of sweet potato paste wrapped in wheat flour dough, was placed on a chestnut leaf, probably to herald the impending autumn. Sometimes a dish could even give rise to poetic contemplation – the rice course was served with salmon roe, baby sardines and grilled Pacific saury, which seemed to represent three stages of growth in the life of a fish (eggs, young fish and adult fish).

I was fortunate to sit next to a Japanese couple who loved gastronomic adventures as much as I did. Conversing with locals is generally a challenge in Japan, so I was delighted at the opportunity to speak to the couple, who came from Nagoya and were in Osaka for a concert. We spoke about how expensive restaurants in Singapore were (they had been to Zen, a three-starred Nordic restaurant) and how delectable bánh mì was (they visited Vietnam recently). They recommended some unagi eateries in Nagoya, which I hope to visit one day. From my conversation with them, I also learnt about the joy of pione grapes, which turned up in a dessert, or the allure of aka uni, which they deemed a treat. The world of Japanese ingredients never ceases to fascinate me. ",finedining

1729530445.0,"Alouette (*), Copenhagen ","Some highlights and impressions from Friday's dinner at Alouette. 
I've eaten there around 20 times, so you may consider me a fan. They recently moved the restaurant from an anonymous backyard filled with band practice rooms and entrance via a super dodgy elevator filled with stickers and graffiti to a much fancier place in front of The King's Garden in the centre of Copenhagen. This was my second visit at the new location. 

Food:
Signature bread. A brioche style bread served with butter whipped with apple cider and a kind of lardo fat. This used to be served alongside the meal, but it's now been turned into a more intense starter. Bread is nice and fluffy, being both sweet and salty, the lardo adding fatness and the cider acidity. 

Tomatoes and gooseberry. Grilled, peeled and pickled tomatoes in a cold broth. Nice refreshing starter with lots of acidity to wake up your palate. Good dish, but I felt I had something similar and better at Kadeau. 

Raw shrimp with almond milk and habanada. Wonderful dish, mild but complex at the same time, the raw shrimps where super fresh with a lovely texture. A rather sweat starter but the habaneros gave it a nice warmness that worked as a flavour enhancer. Raw shrimp are really in fashion in Danish restaurants and this shows why.

Hokkaido, roasted sunflower seeds and caviar. Another Alouette classic, even though they've changed the preparation a bit over time. Buttery ""nuttyness"" paired really well with the complex saltiness of the caviar.

Grilled kale with XO sauce made from scallops. The smoked flavours and burnt bitterness of the kale paired well with the perfume and heavy umami of the XO sauce. It was paired with an IPA which was pretty fun. I still felt this was the weakest of the savoury dishes, I'm a bit tired and unimpressed by kale in general to be honest. 

Lamb, eggplant and aromatic bread. Simple, yet extremely yummy, dish. First I thought the bread was a cheap trick to fill me up, but it actually served a purpose. Every time you dipped the bread in the sauce, the minty herbs refreshed the palate and lifted up the very intense signature bone sauce, making every new mouthful as exciting as the first.

Pear and apple desserts. They where alright.

Impressions:
All in all another great meal at Alouette, the highlights being the raw shrimps, the hokkaido/caviar and the lamb. The weakest dishes perhaps the desserts, I'm a huge dessert lover and hard to impress. Also a really good wine pairing. 
Service is great, perhaps the best in Copenhagen. Friendly, fun, relaxed and chatty without being too intruding. 

Now on to the negative part of my visit, and I'm a bit sad to write this. I really don't like the new place that much. It lacks the funny personality of the old location and just has boring, generic international Michelin restaurant vibes. Worse is the lounge where they serve coffee, digestif and sweet bits after. This room has about as much charm as an airport traffic lounge and it kind of bummed me out. Also, I have a mild night blindness and the room and the adjacent toilet and stairs are pretty dark. To add insult to injury, instead of serving a small selection of mignardises like they used to, they now only serve one kind of madelaine style cookie and raised the prices considerably. 

Conclusion: 
Alouette is still my favourite 1 star restaurant in Denmark nothing that evening changed that. But I hope they will spend some time dolling up the new joint a bit over time. Why so serious?

1729504872.0,"Zén, Singapore ***, 10/19/2024","1-5: Canapés in the lower level lounge - worlds greatest ritz cracker, beef tartare, couple others I can’t remember exactly what they were, braised mushrooms - all delicious. 6: The day’s ingredients viewed before going upstairs 7: Crudo with caviar, chutoro, Argan oil, finger lime 8: Chawanmushi with king crab, ikura, saffron 9: Onion, almond, liquorice soup 10: Turbot, razor clam, goat butter, artichoke 11: French toast with unagi and blue mussel 12: Grilled scallop, hot sauce, spruce, chrysanthemum 13: A5 wagyu, perigord truffle jus, wasabi 14: Amelia tomato, coconut, passion fruit sorbet 15: Salted milk ice cream, rum and raisin, banana and foie gras shavings 16: fruit 17: Petits fours 18: more petits fours and after dinner drinks 19: Madelines (even more petits fours, roll me out of here please) 

I was extremely excited to get a reservation here as I had heard nothing but good things about both Frantzén and Zén. When I found myself in Singapore on a layover, I jumped at the chance to dine here. I had very high expectations going in given the pedigree and they were exceeded. This was a phenomenal meal from start to finish with impeccable service and atmosphere. 

Starting with the food - the first several canapés are served in the lower level lounge that overlooks the kitchen. All of the canapés were great, single bite dishes that were very exciting. They also made one of the best Gin and Tonic’s I’ve had here. After the canapés, you head upstairs to the main dining room for dinner. Pretty much everything here was phenomenal. Highlights included the onion and almond soup - a standard of theirs for good reason. It was just a masterclass of savory balance. The scallop was also perfectly grilled and delicious. Savory French toast was another long-time dish I had heard about before. The French toast stays the same but the toppings change. This evening it was with Unagi and mussel. Delicious but made an already very seafood-heavy menu even more seafood heavy (not necessarily a bad thing, but I had seen previous iterations of this dish drenched in truffles which could have been a nice break from all the seafood courses). Perhaps the only thing that wasn’t perfect was the tomato and coconut sorbet palate cleanser. It was an odd sweet and savory combination that I thought clashed. After main courses and dessert, you then head up to the third floor for petits fours and after dinner drinks. Petits Fours were again delicious but honestly by that time we had been given so much food and drink that it was hard to keep going. As an aside - I know there is supposedly a new Nordic focus here but honestly I didn’t get much of that. To me it felt like a combination of Japanese and classic European flavors. Not a criticism just an observation that I didn’t notice many new Nordic influences here. 

The service was flawless. Perfectly balanced between serious and engaging and light. Everybody was extremely warm and welcoming as well. Extra points to the Somm/GM who has a) put together an EXTREMELY exciting wine list that is not just the usual *** tour of GC burgundy and first growth Bordeaux but had some phenomenal lesser known producers and older vintages and b) wasn’t trying to upsell but helped me find a new barolo producer I wasn’t familiar with (we ended up having a 1996 Corino Barolo Vigna Ciachini which was fantastic). We had originally ordered a different bottle but it was flawed and he fixed that immediately - and even asked my opinion about the origin of the flaw which was fun figuring that out together. 

Finally the atmosphere was phenomenal. I loved the progression from Canapés on the first floor, dinner on the second, and petits fours on the upper level. The space was warm and inviting - they managed to nail Scandinavian Hygge feeling despite being in tropical Singapore. And I need to give another complement to the soundtrack. It was banging - just hit after hit of Motown, classic rock, etc. Really kept the atmosphere light and fun juxtaposed with serious food. 

Overall this is a kitchen and staff that are firing on all cylinders. Utterly delicious benchmark food in a perfectly warm setting with flawless service. Easily top 5 meals ever and I can’t wait to return and also figure out an excuse to go to Stockholm for Frantzén. ",finedining

Going in I expected Alchemist to be an experience first with the food being secondary. However it is the exact opposite. The experience enhanced the food and not vice versa. Furthermore the service staff was by far the most knowledgeable I’ve ever experienced. 

Like myself, a lot of us on here have been to more than a few three and two star experiences in more than one country.

1729411295.0,PSA about how Tabelog scores are computed,"The score is not the average, and is very far divorced from it. And it's not even because of differential weighting between food, cost performance, service, drinks. One of the factors known is popularity among influential people.

Here's an example:  
Ushigoro S Ginza and Ushigoro S Nishiazabu  
[https://tabelog.com/en/tokyo/A1307/A130701/13209611/dtlratings/](https://tabelog.com/en/tokyo/A1307/A130701/13209611/dtlratings/)  
[https://tabelog.com/en/tokyo/A1301/A130101/13222093/dtlratings/](https://tabelog.com/en/tokyo/A1301/A130101/13222093/dtlratings/)

Ushigoro S Ginza Tabelog Score 4.24  
Ushigoro S Nishiazabu Tabelog Score 3.86

Nearly .4 of difference; seems pretty substantial when probably 95% of restaurants fall between 3 and 4.

But when you look at the average score of reviews, it's 4.20 vs 4.21 (for Ginza). Not very substantial. Even if you look at review counts, Ginza has about 700 reviews vs 500 for Nishiazabu. About the same range I'd say.

Now break it down by category  
Food 4.28 vs 4.30  
Service 4.24 vs 4.28  
Atmosphere 4.31 vs 4.26  
Drinks 3.93 vs 3.93  
Cost performance 3.77 vs 3.82

Basically, there is no difference. And if you're only mildly observant, you've probably figured out these are two branches of the same restaurant. So what drives the difference? It's likely because Ginza is the flagship and has more influencers there (and also these people are less likely to review the 2nd/3rd branches or even go there at all. Why would you go to the second branch if you can go anywhere you want?). If you extrapolate this, you can figure out that you can only get into the mid 4s by being popular among influencers. So it's only natural any place with a high score is hard to book.

What should you do with this information?

I'd probably not fret about the Tabelog score and look at the average (and really more importantly, what you want to eat. But the food average is probably a good proxy for how well executed it is vs. just how it looks). You'll see there's a ton of places with a high food score that are easy to book.

Really, consider the actual food you are booking and not just a number. If you looked at Omino and Omino Kamiyacho a year ago, they had a .4 score difference with a similar food average, but one serves more strict yakitori and the other more kaiseki style. You'd be better off booking your preference of food rather than chasing a high score which is meaningless. In the end, it's kind of like chasing Michelin stars.

I won’t be including a ton of details as to not ruin the surprise for anyone. If you have any questions I’m happy to answer. 

So the restaurant is in an ambience I can only describe as “art gallery owner decides to open a restaurant and hotel”. It’s very modern and I guess you’re supposed to feel like it’s a modern art museum dining area, but for me it just struck me as trying too hard. But let’s be real, we aren’t in this hobby to sit in nice rooms. It’s about food. So here goes. 


This is place where you couldn’t recreate most dishes without fancy kitchen contraptions. That is the appeal. 

I found one particular dish so salty I had to tell the staff (I’ve only done that one other time in my life; a chain Mexican restaurant where I got the tortilla soup).   

The food itself was okay by 3* standards. Fabulous by other standards. 

It feels like you’re there to see how to deconstruct and reconstruct meals.  It was cool to see how a science nerd would cook from scratch, but I found the tastes to be secondary to the elaborate techniques.  

I don’t have a “memorable favorite dish” for taste between the appetizers and main course. I do however have it Imprinted in my brain how they could take a common salad and absolutely nail the taste with a liquid that had color and consistency of water.  There are other “wow how did they do that” moments throughout. That’s what I found to be so fantastic. 

Dessert was a different story. It was next level great. My next trip to Spain will include a trip to ABaC just for the dessert, I’ll probably meander through the beginning though. Maybe I’ll bring a guest without a sweet tooth and trade my apps/meal for their desserts. 

All in all I found this to be a “stereotypical fancy restaurant they mock on TV” in the way it was presented. I found the appeal to lie in how smoke and mirrors can trick your eyes and tastebuds. 

I appreciate the experience and seeing it more than the actual flavors of the food itself. 

TL;DR— flavors felt second to elaborate technique/plating. That’s more a reflection on the latter than quality of the former. The flavors were 1-2* Michelin. The techniques were what made it up to 3* as a whole. 

If someone told me they could do one three star meal in BCN I would not make this choice 1, but I would not dissuade them either.

1729274884.0,"Fruit Universe at Mirazur (***🍀) - Menton, FR - October 2024 ","After our visit at Disfrutar in August, we were hungry for another fine dining adventure, and no better occasion than both mine and my girlfriend’s birthdays being 2 weeks apart. Cue, Mirazur. We were interested by their lunar cycle menu, which changes daily depending on the current cycle of the moon. The menu is presented in 4 universes - Fruit, Leaves, Roots and Flowers, each focusing on a different type of ingredients used in the dishes.

We had the Fruit Universe, consisting of 9 courses at 450 Euro, and I had their Terroir pairing at 190 Euro, focusing on local French wines. My girlfriend had the Historique wine pairing, focusing on natural wines from around the world, at 140 Euro. In total, the experience cost us 1248 EUR for two.

The view from the restaurant table is of a sunset over the lovely Menton. We are welcomed warmly and sat at our table, where a basket of fruit is waiting for us. Not long after, they confirm my girlfriend’s long list of food preferences, and serve us our food. 

Slide 4 - We start off with amuse bouches, we are presented with a white grape tartlet with veal tartare, lobster tartare ‘taco’ , among other bites, and the one pictured - cheesy ravioli. It was a very nice warm bite to start off.

Slide 5 - the first actual course in the tasting menu, listed as ‘Walnut, Squid’ - calamari, razor clams and walnuts in three preparations - walnut oil, walniut milk, and the whole walnut fruit. It was a nice light cold dish to start the experience with, very flavourful, tasting like the sea, but also the crunch of the walnut fruit, combined with the richness of the milk delivered a really well-rounded dish.

Slide 6 - the poem from Chilean poet Pablo Neruda, we are served bread as per Chef Colagreco’s grandmother’s recipe, with olive oil with pink pepper and lemon from Menton. The bread wasn’t really soft and felt quite stiff (not pictured), but the olive oil was lovely. 

Slide 7 - Amanila Tart, mushroom carpaccio on the top, with the inside being mushrooms, cooked with butter, chives and shallots. An outstanding dish, a textbook lesson in umami, very fresh, very inspired. I love it.

Slide 8 - One of two courses I actually forgot to photograph (the wine pairings were 8 glasses for god’s sake, you can imagine how schlossed I was when I left), but thankfully my girlfriend had snapped a picture of it. Funnily enough, also one of my favourite courses of the night. Squash carpaccio, burnt with a flame on top, with tuna tartare underneath, squash puree and squash juice, and mustard ice cream. What a combination of flavours and textures. The tuna was very, very fresh, the preparations of squash tasted sweet, while the mustard ice cream gave a kick to the whole experience. Wowing dish, indeed.

Slide 9 - one of my favourite wines from the wine pairing, Valentin Zusslin Ophrys 2022 - a 2/3 Pinot Noir and 1/3 Pinot Gris. It had this very feint red colour, and tasted a lot, and I mean a lot, like strawberries, raspberries, red fruit. It was gorgeous and combined so well with my favourite dish from this experience, which is:

Slide 10 - Chestnut gnocchi, with chicken jus, chestnut carpaccio on top and sweetbread underneath. This has to be one of my favourite dishes I’ve ever tried, with one of the best wine pairings. Served at the perfect warm temperature, the flavours of the sweetbread and chestnut gnocchi mesh so well together. They create this nostalgic, almost Christmassy flavour, reminiscent of very cozy and warm times. Premium ingredients, combined perfectly. Cannot praise this enough, and the sommelier’s pairing is just genius. Love my experience so far, despite being ill with the flu.

Slide 11 - second serving of the bread, this one is well crunchy and soft, served with local butter from Menton. 

Slide 12 - our 5th course, mushroom stew (blood mushroom, porcini mushrooms and other local mushrooms), cooked with veal sweetbread. Another strong course, the bread was served perfectly so that I could soak in that beautiful stew juice. The kitchen is putting out banger after banger.

Slide 13 - the basket with the mushrooms. Now granted, at this point in time, the table next to us was seated 30 minutes after us and caught up to us and even got their 5th courses before us . We had a 25-30 minute wait between the chestnut gnocchi and this. And they forgot to bring the basket of mushrooms around while serving the dish, so they brought it out after. We even finished our wine pairing with the course before we even the course itself. The sommelier was really nice and gave us a cheeky top up as a nice gesture, but we have been noticing water glasses being empty for a while, having to ask for water once or twice throughout the meal, ice not being replenished, little details that are being overlooked or omitted. I can cut them slack, but this on top of giving the wrong cutlery once, the take-home menus for my girlfriend not including her subs, the wine pairing on the take home menus being wrong, you can’t help but notice multiple small details being overlooked. At this level and calibre of cooking, you’d expect the service to be on par, but unfortunately, we felt a bit underwhelmed by that. That being said, the sommelier team is amazing and brilliant and their pairings are phenomenal.

Slide 14- catch of the day and coffee (Pike with coffee and lemon crepes on top, coffee infusion sauce) - a brilliant course that I also forgot to take a picture of, so using my girlfriend’s. It was really beautifully presented with the coffee and lemon crepes alternating, and the flavour combinations being brilliant. The nutty, deep coffee sauce really worked well with the fish, and the lemon crepes added acidity and variety to the flavour profile of the dish. Really well executed. A masterclass in flavours.

Slide 15 - Red Fruit and beef - beetroot with black fruit and red fruit, beef and cream from pure milk from Menton. Tart, acidic, rich, combining well with the umami of the beef. Another phenomenal course, and thankfully our last main, as we are getting stuffed.

Slide 16 - the first dessert - persimmon with chantilly with rosemary and armagnac from 1976, the chef’s birth year, and walnuts from the garden. My first time trying persimmon, the armagnac cream was simply sublime. Such a great combo together, the persimmon was soft and sweet and served at room temperature, while the armagnac cream gave it a lot of depth and the walnut fruit added the crunch. 

Slide 17 - the wine paired with the previous and following dessert. A 2016 red sparkling wine from Clos de la Bierle, made from Gamay grapes. tasting very fruity, light, kind of like lychee. I loved the pairing here again.

Slide 18 - spelt and ricotta rice pudding, with hay and pastry. Rich, malty, slightly sweet, nutty flavours. Brilliant dessert.


Slide 19 - for our celebration, they served us a squash tiramisu to share. Tiramisu is my favourite dessert ever, so I really, really enjoyed this one. A perfect tiramisu, with squash undertones.

Slide 20 - our petit fours, green apple sorbet, lemon pate de fruit, white chocolate and hazelnut fake peanuts, financier cake, chocolate tartlet. All very good, but my favourite by far was the fake peanuts, the combination of the white chocolate and hazelnut spread fake peanuts was fantastic.

All in all, an amazing meal, sadly let down by patchy service throughout. The sommelier team has done brilliant pairings, the hosts took great care of us, and even booked us a taxi for our way back. Small oversights in detail accumulated and left us feeling a bit iffy about the service at the table, but the food was out of this world. One of the very, very best, and I see why it was the world’s best in 2019. I can definitely recommend Mirazur, if you are in Cote D’Azur. The universe concept was executed well, although due to seasonality they re-used squash, using mushrooms and coffee as “fruit” definitely feels weird, and so does “walnut”. That being said, the fruit concept worked. Definitely an experience and I would happily go back to taste their other “universes”. ",finedining

1729262789.0,63 Clinton (1* NYC) is a great solo dining experience,"I went to 63 Clinton the other night for the second time, the first time was with my wife, this time as a solo diner, and I have to say it’s a particularly great experience as a solo diner.  
  
I reserved a spot at the kitchen counter which gives a great view of everything going on. Cell phone reception sucked for me, so it really encouraged me just to watch everyone at work between courses with no distraction. Started with a Mezcal cocktail which was great, smoky and refreshing.  
  
I decided this time to splurge on the caviar hand roll. Is it worth a 50% premium on the price of the whole tasting menu? No, how could it be, but it’s decadent and delicious anyway. I won’t order it every time, but if the cost isn’t an issue for you, then go nuts, it’s creamy/briny/salty goodness.  
  
The rest of the menu is great as well. Highlights for me included the cabbage (grilled cabbage with melted cheese and hazelnuts, how can you go wrong) and the breakfast taco is a staple on the menu for a reason. The one big miss for me was the île flottante which was oddly too salty and texturally not great. This weak dessert was however made up for by the other dessert served, goats milk ice cream with pine syrup and caviar - sounds weird, but it just works, the pine is nice, and the caviar brings that saltiness like you’d have with a salted caramel, but this is fine dining, so let’s accomplish that contrast with caviar.  
  
So why am I so enthused with this meal? The staff is great. The chefs, the front of house, everyone is so friendly, so welcoming, it’s just a pleasure to interact with them and it makes the solo dining experience there perfect. If you like a cold and formal experience, this isn’t for you, but if like me, you still enjoy human interaction when solo dining, this is the best of any Michelin starred restaurant I’ve been to, and as a solo diner would rank it above Atomix, Atera, and Jua which have been my other solo NYC experiences.

CHT— wow. Traditional cooking methods. Amazing flavors. Great great balance throughout. 

They give you the menu and ask if there is anything you don’t like. I said “squid”. The guy said it was a signature dish and to try it. I did. He was right I was wrong. That was amazing. 

I was not a fan of the main dish fish. It was a weird texture as it was a “different shaped fish”. While I’m sure it was properly cooked, the texture was something I couldn’t get over. It tasted otherwise okay. I’m sure I’m dinging the taste because of texture. I’m grateful to have had this once and happy I’ll never have it again. 

I was a fan of absolutely everything else, and especially the fruit based desserts. As someone who prefers to bake over cook, I need to learn what one in particular  was and how to make it. 

The ambience felt minimal. It was clean and welcoming but not fancy. The staff looked focused and happy. The owner was in the kitchen and no one tensed up when he walked by.  Service was impeccable.

1729205436.0,"Sushi Sanshin, Osaka (Tabelog Gold 4.48, 1*)","
Was fortunate to snag a seat at Sushi Sanshin through the omakase website for October. Usually I don’t have much luck with ‘click battles’  but the reservation window at 08.00 JST really favoured the Australian time zone where I live.

Sat directly in front of the taisho and he said he went for his honeymoon in Australia. Was the only foreigner among the 8 during the first seating (Sanshin opens for lunch only). I asked permission for photo & video and Ishibuchi-san  said it was perfectly fine.

The meal started with in-season matsutake mushrooms simply bathed in dashi broth and piled on top of unseasoned rice to spotlight its texture and natural flavour. This was followed by a trio of delicious otsumami including the signature octopus en route to the nigiri.

‘Bold and Beautiful’ (no pun intended) are the words that come to my mind re: nigiri. A generous amount of sea salt was directly added to the otoro to amplify the flavour, iwashi (sardine) was paired with sticky tororo (mountain yam) for an earthy ping to balance the oiliness, while a “herbal’ handroll consisting of micro leaves and sprouts tasted bittersweet in a good way. The neta were large in size and beautifully angled and shaped. The signature ikura was visually appealing with each sphere of roe individually separated.

Regretted not to do any research beforehand and was taken aback when they passed me a hand-written menu with an extensive array of around 10-15 add-ons. Had ramen for breakfast that day which proved to be a major mistake and consequently I only had the capacity for 3 add-ons. I’d recommend everyone going there soon to skip breakfast and order the extras.

Dessert was served in a separate but cozy, tea house next door where diners could relax after a satisfying lunch. Sanshin offered 2 choices of dessert and 3 choices of closing drinks to give diners even more optionalities. An omiyage box of  inari zushi was a nice ending touch.

Paid a total of 34,400 yen (basic price of 26,400 yen + additional 8000 yen for 3 extra nigiris and 3 cups of nihonshu), which is amazing value for the quality.

1729191089.0,"Californios, SF | 2* | October 2024","My girlfriend and I spent a short time in San Francisco earlier in October. She has never been to the city before, while I have an uncle that lives out there and used to visit fairly frequently. Last time I visited was 2016 and had toyed around with the idea of going to Atelier Crenn, but couldn’t afford it at the time.

For my GF’s first time in San Francisco ever, and mine in 8 years, I wanted to go somewhere special. Unlike in 2016, we can afford fine dining experiences, but having just been at Disfrutar and El Celler de Can Roca earlier in the summer, we didn’t want to break the bank.

After much research, including scouring reddit for recommendations, we landed on Californios, and I am extremely glad we did.

Our reservation was for 8:30pm on a Friday night, and most tables were full and at different stages of their meal. Just a handful were starting just like us. An envelope with my last name written out contained the tasting menu and full details, including the wine pairing, which we ordered while at the table.

The tasting menu consisted of 13 courses, with 9 beverage pairings. The beverage pours were very generous, especially for the pours that paired with several dishes. It was also nice to hear how many courses would be paired with single pour. I’ve been to fine-dining restaurants where they don’t state that, so it’s hard to judge how much to drink per course.  
  
Personally, we found each dish to be delicious. Nothing was a “miss”, although the tasting menu keeps things fairly on the safe side. My personal favorite courses were the Aquachile, which was probably one of the most satisfying flavors I’ve ever had. A pleasing mixture of slightly spicy and refreshing, and a texture. The wine pairing, a bright, minerally 2019 Carricante from Aeris Winery was perfect. My other favorite course was the Codorniz Taco, their version of an Al Pastor taco with Quail, Mole Negro and a Grilled Hawaiian Pinapple, which was paired with two wines, a 2017 Barolo and a 2021 Nebbiolo/Sangiovese blend from Tres Raices, the latter of which I felt paired outstandingly well with the Codorniz. 

My girlfriend adored the palate cleanser (Frutas), which consisted of fresh Strawberries in a vanilla crema, a green strawberry raspado with a strawberry sherbert, and strawberry mint tea. She loved strawberries, so naturally this was right up her alley (and I really enjoyed it too).

Desserts were also exceptional and memorable, such as the outstanding Empanada filled with yellow peaches served with Oaxacan Rum Ice Cream and Buttered Pecans, as well as their take on the Choco Taco, and their version of a Bubulubu in a cotton candy-eque structure. 

As I stated, we loved our experience and personally this was one of the best meals I’ve had in America (as an American). My only major critique was that there were too many iterations of tacos and we would have preferred some additional variations and expressions of Mexican cuisine.In case anyone is wondering, while our reservation via Tock mentioned that dinner for two lasts around 2.5 hours, ours lasted closer to 3.5 hours. I don’t mind that length of time per se, but there were some gaps where it did feel like we were waiting on food longer than we would typically expect for a 13-course meal.
  
We also thought the service was great, leaning towards 3 Michelin-star in quality. We asked to see the kitchen and wine cellar, during which we spoke to owner Val Cantu, who was lovely to chat with, very approachable and down to earth. 

If you are looking for a great Michelin-starred restaurant in San Francisco, highly recommend Californios.

1729166804.0,Disappearance of 2-starred and 3-starred restaurants from Japan's Michelin guides,"Over the years, some three-starred and two-starred restaurants seem to suddenly disappear from Japan's Michelin guides. Official reasons were provided when Sushi Jiro and Sushi Saito were excluded from the guide (they were almost impossible for the public to book). However, some other cases are less well-documented.

For example, Maeda, Iida and Kyoto Kitcho Arashiyama have unexpectedly vanished from the Kyoto guides over the years. There are claims that restaurants in Japan are allowed to withdraw from the Michelin Guide if they wish to, but I have not come across any official confirmation of these claims in English. Are these claims true? If so, do they apply to Maeda, Iida and Kyoto Kitcho Arashiyama? Another case of disappearance pertains to Chihana, which had three stars, burnt down and then has not received any stars since it reopened (the new version of Chihana seems to adopt a more casual style, though, so I wonder if that contributed to its exclusion).

The above trend seems to continue in the Michelin Guide Tokyo 2025.

Makimura, which held three stars for many years, is not listed in the Michelin Guide Tokyo 2025. I wonder if its removal is because, just like Sushi Jiro and Sushi Saito, it has become almost impossible for the public to book.

I have also noticed the sudden disappearance of Sushi Yoshitake and Kobikicho Tomoki. Sushi Yoshitake used to have three stars but became a two-starred restaurant last year. It is no longer listed in the Michelin Guide Tokyo 2025. Since it is not inaccessible to the public and the quality of the food is unlikely to plummet so drastically over the past year, is it a case of Japan's guides allowing a restaurant to withdraw? This is not the first time a restaurant has disappeared from the guide the year after it turned from a three-starred into a two-starred establishment - Azabu Yukimura is another example. Kobikicho Tomoki's disappearance is even more unexpected - it did not lose any star in the previous guide but has suddenly vanished from the two-starred list in the 2025 guide.

On another note, after all the starred ramen eateries were turned into Bib Gourmand establishments in the Tokyo Guide last year, the starred soba places in last year's list (Yuan Yamori and Tamawarai) have lost their star this year, so there are no Michelin-starred soba eateries in Tokyo now. Has there been a change in how the guides perceive ramen and soba places? Are they really less worthy of stars than, say, Tai Hwa Pork Noodle in Singapore, which still retains its star (or Jeju Noodle Bar in New York for that matter)? Is there a wave of correction sweeping through Japan's guides these few years?

I wonder if these issues have been discussed in the Japanese media. Your insights are greatly appreciated.",finedining

1729124835.0,"Vespertine, LA **","We went to Vespertine on our last day in LA. I know this restaurant has had very mixed press but I have to say we thoroughly enjoyed our experience. The dishes were wildly inventive while still holding onto their Californian roots. As someone who has dined at many of the Northern California restaurants, I felt like many of the flavors here resembled ones you will find at some of those restaurants (I.e Harbor House, Saison, and Birdsong) while also incorporating others as far south as Mexico. 

Photos: 
1. Exterior of the restaurant from the outdoor patio. We arrived about 30 minutes early so we waited here for a while until we were seated. The seats in the patio area are warmed but still the space feels a bit confined/awkward due to the large plants taking up a majority of the space. Music reminiscent to the style of music at Alchemist in Copenhagen was playing both inside and outside the restaurant.

2. Champagne to start the meal. We both chose the “dynamic” pairing to go with our dinner. The pairing features 3 N/A pairings, 3 wines, 2 sakes and 1 beer. 

3. Wild scallop with passionfruit and Aji Amarillo. A beautiful start to the meal that balanced elements of sweet, tart, spicy, and savory perfectly. 

4. Kiwi with oxalis and verbena. The first nonalcoholic pairing of the night. It was very tart and a bit sweet.

5. Wildflowers with kiwi and snap peas. A vinaigrette was poured on top and crispy puffed rice was added for some extra crunchy texture. Another wonderful dish. 

6. A sake was poured before this dish but I only have room for 20 pictures. The dish pictured is titled “Deep Ocean” - sweet prawn and nectarine. The dish was served in a giant ice cube. The prawns were velvety the dish was overall good. 

7. Next on the pairing, a white wine from Burgenland in Austria

8. “Obsidian Mirror” with golden osetra caviar (supplementary), smoked mussel, and plum. The idea is to use a clam shell to scoop the mussel cream out of the dish. I thought it was very creative and overall very tasty, and the addition of caviar just made it even better. 

9-10. This next dish featured 2 components and was paired with a rhubarb kombucha. The dish was titled “deep seven”. It featured grilled Kinki and a stuffed Indian mallow flower. It was meant to be eaten by the hand.

11. Red Wine from the Rhône Valley in France

12-13. This course featured multiple components of Coturnix Quail. First it was served with heather and a buttery emulsion. Then a piece of fried oat porridge bread was brought out to mop up the rest of the emulsion, as well as another piece of quail wrapped in a hoja Santa leaf. 

14. Beer from Germany paired with the next course (I also opted for another glass of red wine from the Burgundy region in France, not pictured)

15. Final savory course, pine fed lamb with yeast fudge and magnolia. Very delicious yet mild lamb that paired nicely with the other elements.

16. First of the desserts was titled “Red Earth”. It featured heirloom corn, strawberry, temascal. A hot custard was on the bottom. The dish was extremely warm and a bit spicy, and overall soul-warming. This was paired with a red sake.

17. Caramelized Pancake, lamb fat, single-malt scotch. A spoon was provided for the cream and raspberries which we put on top of the pancake. The pancake was meant to be hand-held and a wet towel was provided. Again, another tasty dish. Hot Douglas fir tea was served as well from here until the end of the meal. The tea was earthy and delicious. One of my favorite flavors in Californian gastronomy.

18. Icy birch with parsnip and reduced milk. Plants are where Vespertine is really able to shine, and I think this dessert resembled that more than any other dish. Extremely earthy flavors that mended together perfectly for a sensational dessert. 

19. The final pairing was a sparkling redwood drink. 

20. “layers” with black raspberry and sheep’s milk. A grand finale to the meal and probably the most photographed dish at the restaurant currently. A red raspberry liquid sat at the bottom. Each of the multiple layers were very different, making each bite a new experience, one layer was crunchy, another frozen, etc. A masterpiece to end the meal. 

Final thoughts: after hearing a lot of mixed reviews, we went in with admittedly pretty low expectations but were pleasantly surprised. The dishes were masterfully presented and the flavors paired beautifully. This was my favorite restaurant experience in LA, and I have to say, 1 of the best I’ve had anywhere in the country.

1729121883.0,Kong Hans Kælder (**) - Copenhagen,"Next on the list for Copenhagen was Kong Hans Kælder. 

This is an intimate spot with a classic fine dining atmosphere — dim lighting and white tablecloths. I personally found the space a bit stuffy (figuratively and literally), but I do understand the appeal.

Service:

The service at Kong Hans was almost without flaw. The staff was impeccable and greeted us as we walked in and answered our questions with enthusiasm. I felt our sommelier was especially passionate and I could feel that through our discussion. 

The only hiccup during service was being served flat sparkling water instead of the still water I requested halfway through the service. An honest mistake, but noticeable nonetheless.

Food:

I’ll give the disclaimer here that my palate leans more towards punchy flavors. I think the dishes were well done for what they were, but not everything matched my preference (perhaps this just speaks to my taste for French cuisine).

I’d personally skip the juice offerings if visiting again.

1. Oyster & horseradish - 6/10. Not a fan of horseradish but the oysters were alright.

2. Shrimp Cocktail - 8.5/10. Great bite, with a pleasant mix of salty, sweet and a nice crunch.

3. King Crab - 6/10. Nothing special. 3 o’ clock.

3. Caviar & Quail Egg - 3/10. I don’t think I understood this dish. The caviar and quail egg seemed to work against each other rather than with, so I might be missing something. 9 o’ clock. 

3. The best from the goose (whipped foie gras) - 6/10. I like foie gras, but didn’t get much taste from this. 6 o’ clock. 

4. Pissaladiere - 7/10. Warm with an interesting texture. 9 o’ clock.

4. Mushroom a la crème - 6/10. Nothing memorable. 3 o’ clock (I believe)

4. Fasandwich - 7/10. Beautiful presentation on this dish, my dining partners enjoyed the flavor far more than I did. 6 o’ clock.

5. Bread and Butter - 8/10. Deliciously salted butter with solid bread - only felt the bread was a slight bit dry.

6. Caviar & Potato - 9/10. Hearty dish. The potato excellently balanced out the saltiness of the caviar. No complaints. 

7. Turbot - 7/10. This was deboned tableside and then served with a sauce on top. I did enjoy this, but felt like it was just good fish. I didn’t think there was anything particularly special / wouldn’t be surprised if I had received this dish somewhere in the states. 

8. Scallop - 7/10. The scallop was cooked to perfection, but I didn’t find texture of the added truffle or assorted bits in the sauce to my liking.

9. Quail - 8.5/10. A pleasant departure from the heavier sauce that dominated the menu. The sauce was excellent. Plated beautifully and cooked very well. 

10. White truffle and Gnocchi - 8.5/10. Rich and warm.  No complaints here, this was a good dish, but at the same time I didn’t think there was anything particularly innovative or special going on. 

11. Pithivier - 8/10. Very impressive presentation and a well balanced bite. Our party was an odd number so we were given an extra left-over serving of this.  

12. Champagne granita - 8.5/10. Citrusy, refreshing.  A good palate cleanser

13. Blueberry en surprise - 9/10. Amazing mix of crunch and sweetness. A brilliant dessert with delightful presentation. 

14. Dessert Trolley - 6-8.5/10. An effort in quantity with a few gems shining through. Seemingly endless plates (12 courses, to be exact) of desserts of varied quality and nature. My favorites were the citrus tart and pate de fruit. Didn’t care for the marshmallow or butter cookie. Packed the remainder to go which was a nice touch.


For an experience at this price point, I was hoping to be blown away by at least one dish. Kong Hans, while having high quality dishes with strong preparation, did not do that for me.",finedining

1729031720.0,Restaurant Koan  - Copenhagen (**),"My experience at Koan was quite interesting. I haven't seen too much about it on this subreddit so I wanted to share some information for anyone interested in visiting.

Koan has a quaint space by the water with a beautifully designed wood interior (designed by the same person who crafted the mignardise boxes). I stopped by for a 6 PM reservation, and immediately ran into the first hiccup of the service. I arrived admittedly early for the reservation, at around 5:45 PM, but was not allowed to enter the restaurant / lobby despite catching the attention of a staff member inside.

Service: 

Once allowed in closer to 6, we were briskly led to our seats. The service at Koan is run precise and tight — dishes placed down in synchronization, chairs pushed in as we sat, and constant replacements of napkins and refills of waters. 

This made the few issues I had later in service all the more confusing. Two points of issue stood out to me. First, when I attempted to visit the restroom between two of the courses, the staff denied my request and instructed me to wait until after the next course. While I understand that certain courses might be best experienced at precise temperatures, this was definitely surprising to me (given the Mandoo course didn’t seem to require this) and left a negative impression. The second large issue was that after service was complete, we were not brought a check until we actively flagged down a staff member. We had waited close to thirty minutes post service before being able to leave as we had assumed there was another course (or something of the sort) if they were not bringing us a check. 


Food:

1. Opening Bites - 7/10. Highlight of these was the langoustine at 6 o’ clock. The kimchi at 10 o’ clock was my least favorite and lacked taste.
2. Stewed Oyster - 9/10. A nice warm bite full of flavor. No complaints.
3. Chilled Lobster Noodles - 6/10. Wanted to love this one, but the broth seriously lacked much flavor. 
4. White Kimchi - 8/10. Very sweet apple-based kimchi. Unlike anything I’ve had before.
5. Caviar with langoustine cream - 8/10. I felt the langoustine cream overpowered most of this dish, but no complaints. 
6. Mandu - 6/10. Good dumplings, but I believe my enjoyment would’ve been similar if not greater from any soup dumpling. Was not impressed. 
7. Bread w/ Butter - 9/10. Delicious pull-apart bread served with a sweet butter. 
8. Taste of Sundae - 6/10. Not to my palate, I don’t like Sundae. Strong flavor and a heavy tartlet.
9. Langoustine with petals and Ribeye - 6.5/10. This was the dish I’ve seen the most of before visiting Koan. I had high hopes for it and was unfortunately let down. The dish ended up being quite chewy and while being beautifully presented didn’t give me much to clamor about.
10. Gamasot Rice & Fjord Shrimps - 8.5/10. Delicately peeled tiny fjord shrimps were a true testament to the effort behind the scenes at Koan. I love the salty flavor when bites had a good amount of roe, but the bites that didn’t fell a bit flat and were under seasoned. 
11. Caramelized Rice - 6/10. Was expecting a dish focused on Nurungji from the name and description, but this ended up being a soup that lacked that flavor. A bit a of a disappointment. 
12. Citrus Ice Cream - 8/10. I don’t remember the details of this dish, but it was a good start to the dessert course. Refreshing and citrusy in a tasty broth.
13. Souffle & Toasted Seaweed Ice cream with Hazelnut Oil and Caviar - 10/10. Absolutely amazing. One of the best desserts I’ve ever had. This dish made my impression of Koan go up by an entire point or more. The caviar worked so well with the hazelnut oil + ice cream and the Souffle was cooked to perfection.
14. Mignardise - 7/10. Nothing truly special here. Decent bites, but nothing I will remember. 

The only dish that truly blew me away was (13), which they identified as being the signature dish from a previous year.

I’ve noticed that places like Sei Less and Pergola are often labeled as upscale or trendy but don’t seem to be classified as ""fine dining"" here. I’m curious—why aren’t they considered fine dining?

They have great food and a stylish atmosphere, but is it because they focus more on the social or nightlife aspect rather than the formal dining experience? Or does fine dining have to stick to certain traditions like tasting menus, service style, or ambiance?

1728978700.0,"Best place in Paris to celebrate 30th - Plenitude, Le Cinq, or other?","Hi everyone, I'm turning 30 soon and really want to celebrate big. I've never really thrown a party for myself or done much besides a nice dinner, typically with my mother—admittedly last year's at Lasserre was truly wonderful (best duck a l'orange I've ever had!)—but I figure this is the birthday to go all-out, and I want to do a 3-star restaurant for my birthday, something that I would never do for any other occasion and will likely not have the opportunity to do again. 

I made a reservation at Plenitude some months ago, but I recently started dating someone who wants to join and treat me for my birthday dinner, and as such I want to make sure he also really enjoys the experience. Here's the issue: he doesn't like seafood of any kind, and it seems to me that a lot of Plenitude's dishes are fish-focused. I'm sure they could accommodate him, but given the expense of Plenitude and that he has been saving up to treat me to this meal (although I keep offering to at the very least split it, or pay for it myself, as I've also been saving up!) I really don't want him to be disappointed with the experience. 

  
In addition, it seems like Plenitude normally offers a beautiful view of Paris, but in the winter when it gets dark so early, I'm not sure we'll be able to appreciate it as much as if, say, we went in the middle of summer when we'd still have bright clear skies.

  
So I'm reconsidering now, and wondering if I should pick another restaurant where perhaps we just order a la carte so that he can get something he really loves, and where the ambiance isn't focused on having a view of Paris when it'll be hard to see outside. I just booked a spot at Le Cinq to have as a backup, and I've read through some posts that were really positive about Le Cinq. But would I be missing out if I don't do Plenitude? I guess my question is: should I only do Plenitude if I'm going with someone who eats *everything* and really enjoys that type of experience? My boyfriend does enjoy fine dining but is a really picky eater, and I grew up in a family that loves to experiment with different foods and gets excited to try new and interesting things. Would Le Cinq be a more classical experience that my boyfriend would enjoy? And would that still feel like a really special place to celebrate a milestone birthday? Or is there another place someone would recommend for this type of occasion? I see a lot of people love Epicure; I wonder if that would be a better choice?

Had lunch on 10/4 where you could pick two appetizers, a main, and a dessert from the a la carte menu. I went by myself and was seated at the bar where you could watch dishes being plated, which was really cool.

Amuse bouche: pork rillettes

Appetizers: Lobster and eel, my server's recommendation

Main: Duck

Dessert: Pavlova

Petit fours: Lemon and chocolate entremets

I think the lobster appetizer was my favorite of all the courses. The tomatoes in the dish were the most flavorful I've ever had. And the sauce was really sweet and citrusy. I don't know if it was appropriate, but I couldn't resist using some of the bread to mop it up. It was a bit awkward to eat around the head shell though.

The bread was great too. Super soft (the milk bread) and crunchy (sourdough and baguette). I wish they had served it with some butter, would've made it perfect.

The eel was really rich and soft, on a crunchy green yam base. I actually thought it was lotus as first, before I asked again.

The duck was okay. It felt kind of chewy and tough. The slices were thin but hard to cut and I wished it had more sauce and flavor. My server had recommended a different main and now I wish I had gone with that but I wanted to have a non-seafood course as well.

The pavlova dessert was really good! It came with raspberry coulis. I was tempted by the chocolate option but I'm glad I went with this as it was really tasty and a good lighter end to a rich meal. Plus I'd never had pavlova.

Petit fours were great as well. I was super full but still wanted seconds. Their citrusy dishes/desserts were all really impressive.

1728951485.0,"Benu, San Francisco (***)","Hello everyone! First time poster here. I ate at Benu for the first time recently. It was my first three-star experience. And lo and behold, the other day I was scrolling and noticed somebody else had posted shots from *their* recent trip to Benu, featuring an almost identical course. I felt inspired to join in and share my thoughts.

In terms of calibration: I've recently been to Angler (an SF one-star) and Asaba (an excellent ryokan in the Shizuoka prefecture of Japan). A while back I dined at Lazy Bear. My recollection of the SF experiences is that they were awesome and worth the money.

Upon arrival, you may actually have a little trouble discerning where the entrance to the restaurant is. It's very low-key, with no signage. Pretty cool. Love the confidence. The courtyard contains an array of jugs where the restaurant ferments its condiments.

Entering the restaurant, I have to say I was immediately disappointed. The interior of the restaurant is insistently low-key, with bland and bare paneling along the walls. The furnishing reminded me of the style you see at mid to lower-end ryokans. The lighting was not particularly flattering for the food or people. I think I get what they were going for, but it didn't work for me. The service had kind of a similar laid-back and stripped-down vibe. Generally cool, but I thought the vibes were a miss at such an expensive establishment.

Getting into the food now. The service began with a series of ""small delicacies"". These were by and large excellent.

* Century quail egg. I think this is a mainstay at Benu, for good reason. I love century eggs and this one was as good as they get.
* Glazed mussel with sliced egg and vegetables. Easily the most visually impressive dish of the evening. Very complex textures on the palette. It boggles the mind to think of the labor that goes into preparing such an intricate dish.
* Maine eel. I forgot exactly what was in this thing but it was delicious.
* Fried frog legs with Sichuan flavors. Accompanied by a reminder that the peppers are not to be eaten. I fuck with toothpick lamb all day long, so these words were wasted on me. Anyway, excellent stuff.
* Local anchovy on tomato-infused sourdough. Really, REALLY good. Didn't think I liked anchovies, but I sure liked this one.
* Iberico ham and truffle taco. Loved the generous truffle shavings. Nothing really complex happening here but it's an explosion of flavor.
* Poached scallop. Or something. Don't remember the details. It essentially tasted to me like fish paste in a pleasant broth.

As this section of the service wrapped up and we rotated into the main dishes (i.e. the stuff actually printed on the menu), I was in high spirits. Unfortunately, this is where the food started to miss my expectations. I thought the meal was just beginning, but in reality most of what would ultimately be the evening's highlights were already done with.

* Fresh bread and butter, with honey. Delicious, of course. But nothing memorable here.
* Xiaolongbao, with pine mushroom broth. Great, but honestly as a big fan of Din Tai Fung I didn't feel like I tasted anything groundbreaking here.
* Shrimp, tripe, coriander, and mixed vegetables (with rice). Delicious shrimp. Very delicate. Sweet, buttery flavor. The other ingredients here didn't leave as much of an impression on me but it all worked great together.
* Geoduck, kimchi, seaweed (with rice). I've never tried geoduck. I didn't really enjoy it, but I understand that it's a delicacy and I credit the restaurant giving me something new to experience. Nothing remarkable about the kimchi and seaweed in my utterly, comically uninformed opinion.
* Sea bream. Very tasty, but it's essentially just a small portion of fried fish.
* Barbecued quail. This is the crown jewel. The centerfold. The money-maker. Apparently these birds are raised on a small farm in the area and hand-picked for the restaurant. The quail was phenomenally flavorful and tender. Best-I've-ever-had type stuff. It was accompanied by some pickled vegetables, sauces, and a bun. It also came with a small dollop of a very rich spread which I don't remember the details about but which had the texture of a whipped pâté. I mainly remember being baffled by the presence of this spread, which didn't seem to go with either the bun served with the quail or with the quail itself.

And that's it. At this point, I was still hungry and began to reflect mournfully on the meal's underwhelming middle act. I'm proud of my appetite, but, even so, usually by this point in a Michelin-star prix fix course I'm flat on my back begging the chef for mercy. But not this time.

After the entrees, we were offered tea. We said ""yes please,"" and the tea duly arrived in a plane porcelain cup. The tea was good but it compared pretty unfavorably to tea courses I've had at other restaurants e.g. Lazy Bear. On to dessert. Which consisted of:

* Green yuja punch with muscat grape. The grape just a grape, but it was a very special grape.
* Black sesame ice cream with apple strudel. The apple strudel contained lily bulbs, which were interesting and tasty. This dessert didn't really do it for me, as I'm not a big ice-cream-at-restaurants guy. Like, it's hard for me to think of a category if desserts which is easier to prepare and serve. And the strudel didn't really blow my mind. Although the addition of lily bulbs was unique.

Including wine, the bill was comfortably over $1,000 for two people. Overall, I had a great meal at Benu. But at this price, it's hard to recommend.

My wife and I are visiting Austria end of November and into the first week of December. We are doing two nights in Vienna to start, hitting various Christmas Markets.

Hoping to do some skiing (weather permitting) as it's always been a dream of mine to ski the Alps. We are dining at Oniriq one of the nights there and the rest we are not certain. We are spending one night in Salzburg where we intend to check out St Peter's Abbey, the markets, and eventually beers and grub at Augustiner Brau Mulln. Then it's back to Vienna for two nights before flying home to the States. We want to fit in a Heuriger visit, the Belvedere Palace, and the Schonbrunn Palace in these last two days/nights. But ultimately - we want to end the trip with a super memorable dinner. We are debating between MAST, Vestibul, and Apron but I'm also on a the waitlist for Mraz & Sohn. Apron looks amazing but some reviews have made me concerned of their waitstaff professionalism and some have raised questions about the flavors (bland dishes, competing ingredients that don't work well together). Vestibul looks like a beautiful setting but kind of crowded and from what I understand quite loud. The OG chef is no longer running the kitchen at either of these locations which is cause for concern. MAST seems like a safe bet for the price and I need to dig into the reviews a bit more to be honest....WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

1728912093.0,"Tairroir, 3* (Taipei, Taiwan)","I don’t think I’ve ever been to a starred restaurant that was so far off the marks.

3 stars you’re expecting great things, and at least a very good baseline meal. Tairroir was 1 star, 2 at a real stretch and that’s being incredibly generous.

Food is mostly uninspired with dishes that you could probably find in any decent modern European restaurant, starred or not. The mushroom potage, fish and beef courses could easily be hotel banquet food. 

As usual there’s a good concept to start with: wanting to showcase Taiwanese produce and inspiration from Taiwanese cuisine. But like too many places they require so much editing with components and courses that just seem pointless.

Said mushroom soup wasn’t far off from a can, and the bread course was simply pointless, neither being of good quality or intresting.

Worst of all was the somm. When I asked what was in the pairing he says 2 Spanish whites and a Chilean red. Ok, what are the producers?

“For the 2 Spanish they’re small producers, you won’t know of them… and for the red it’s Montes”

“Ok… but what’s the name of the 2 Spanish whites”

“Oh you won’t know who they are”

Like wtf dude, is it because you don’t know who they are? Perhaps show me the bottles? Tell me the region, grape etc?

He then tried to tell me about Bruno Clair being one of the great unheard of Chambolle producers (um ok, definitely not).

Best of all, when I asked for a glass of intresting white he suggested R de rieussec, like ok no not a good wine. He then suggest a dry Tokaji and I go oh! Is it Oremus (which I do like and find intresting) and he must have been so flabbergasted that someone else aside from him had heard about this wine before.

1728876797.0,Lefties: Do staff notice your handedness during meals?,"We recently had a pair of meals with a left-handed family member. It's the first time we've been to any sort of fine dining with him, and at the first meal - Roots (*), in York - they noticed after the first course that he was left-handed, and confirmed with him at the next course. They proceeded to set his place opposite to ours for the rest of the meal.

At our next meal - Story (**), in London) - they not only failed to notice, but on at least one occasion he switched the sides of his silverware before the dish had arrived, and they switched the silverware back to its original placement.

This left me wondering: For those of you who are left-handed, do staff take note? And do they alter your place settings?

1728767515.0," Autumn visit - Muromachi Wakuden (Kyoto, Tabelog 4.15)","Wasn’t planning to have a meal in Kyoto as our Japan trip itinerary doesn’t actually include the golden triangle route. Somehow I managed to snag reservation at Sushi Sanshin in Osaka using omakase website, and consequently, we had to alter our itinerary. In order to make the detour more worthwhile, we decided to also squeeze in a dinner in Kyoto.

Not going to write a detailed review as Muromachi Wakuden is fairly bookable and probably has been reviewed many times here. My visit in October coincided with the autumnal mushroom season and the majority of the dishes had mushrooms elements. 

Meal highlights were 1) ‘Nariaiyaki’, a generous serving of hamo (daggertooth pike eel) rolled and stuffed with  matsutake mushrooms, 2) plump Kotake mushroom from Iwate deep-fried to perfection and 3) medicinal Suimono (lidded dish) which contained 8 types of different mushrooms. Fruits (whole plum, figs, melon) were also incorporated into several dishes to bestow freshness and contrast.

Wakuden is proud of its cultivated rice (runs its own organic paddy fields in Kyotango) hence the meal finished with carbs offering (you can go all out or opt out). I went the full house and in total had 7 bowls of carbs (rice with kotake, eggplant somen, plain rice x 2, saba sushi, seaweed somen, & yam rice) with more rice to take home as onigiri omiyage.

Overall, a pleasant and well executed meal without really mind-blowing. At 22,000 yen incl tax & service charge, the price is at the low-end range for dinner in Kyoto. Atmosphere was a tad busy with staffs running around as guests dined at different times through the evening rather than starting at the same time. 

Menu (October 2024):

1. Crab, Rock Mushroom, Chrysanthemum, Melon
2. Kotake Mushroom Tempura, Gingko, Karasumi, Rice
3. Tai (seabream), Uni, Finger Lime
4. Assorted Kinoko, Walnut Tofu, Bonito Broth
5. Grilled Ayu (sweet fish), Uruka sauce
6. Hamo (eel), Matsutake Mushroom, Pickled Plum

The meat course was lamb ratatouille (deconstructed?) which weirdly had pork belly included.

1728751803.0,"Smyth (***); A Guarded, Yet Happy Meal ","So, it’s no secret in r/finedining that Smyth has been a polarizing meal across many reviews. I was worried about coming here after what I had read, but didn’t tell my wife. I thought it would be an interesting experiment to see what her fresh thoughts were, having read nothing, versus mine. 

We have a background of eating at many 3 star Michelins across the globe, so we were interested in how Smyth would stack up. We didn’t do alcohol pairing because we were here for the marathon and trying to stay hydrated before (I know, so anal).

Seeing as how we weren’t partaking in wine parings, we had a couple of mocktails that were suggested to us; they had a nice list of about 8 different ones. 

The atmosphere was great, in our opinion. Very cozy. A lot of relaxed than other 3-starred places we had been to where I feel out of place without a suit on. The staff was very engaging from the beginning to the end, making a fuss for my wife’s birthday, all signing a card for her saying thank you for coming. Every time someone came to present a meal, they were very engaging and lovely. This was a welcome surprise, as I had heard the opposite from some posts. Even at the end of the meal, the moment that I had dreaded where they explained the service charge was not a tip, was done very professionally, I thought. The gentlemen who brought us the check explained, “I just wanted to discuss the service charge at the restaurant here with you. It is for the staff here so we can pay everyone a wage that we deem fair for their efforts. There is a line for a tip as well. We encourage you to leave whatever you feel comfortable leaving for the service, and we don’t want you to feel any pressure to leave anything additional.” I left more than I was going to in my mind before he said that. It was handled so nicely.

These are some pictures of the meal. A few overall thoughts:

 I get why it’s a polarizing meal for those that visit. My wife and I disagreed about the success of some courses, but we agreed that it really depended on HOW you were eating each dish. I almost feel like the meal is prismatic in this way. 

 The caviar dish was one of the best examples. I see how a recent poster didn’t care for it. I think, oddly enough, if you really enjoy caviar alone, you wouldn’t care for this dish. The drizzle on top of the caviar, done table-side, was described as a “syrup-like” taste. It had almond and hazelnut butter dabs inside the bowl. Under it was a cream with sunflower oil presentation. I did not care for this, as I found that having oil/cream/butter/syrup/caviar in one spoonful was a bunch of flavors that were neither working in concert with each other, nor were they highlighting the caviar. I found that my enjoyment changed depending on what was in the bite I had collected with my spoon. So, intra-dish, I was finding certain bites pleasing, and certain bites not. My wife, on the other hand, loved the dish because she was eating the elements alone. It wasn’t really described HOW you should eat this dish, as they had done with other dishes, like the finger foods. Maybe that’s the idea? That it is prismatic and depends on you and your decisions/palate. I’d like the think that this is the idea.

My favorite dish was the lobster. I was confused, as I had heard mixed things about this dish as well. The lobster was well-cooked, and the reduction was soo good I could have drank a whole cup of it and asked for me. The last time I felt like that was Paul Bocuse’s truffle reduction with Bresse  chicken. It was really beautiful.

My wife said she thought the meal was “a lot of fun.” Definitely our favorite restaurant that we’ve been to in Chicago, and I would recommend it to anyone. ",finedining

1728750012.0,"Ertilio Namas (No stars...yet) Vilnius, Lithuania","Currently travelling around Europe and I'll be visiting a bunch of fine dining restaurants ranging from 0 stars to 3. In particular though, I enjoy shedding light on places that don't perhaps get all the accolades, but none the less produce a really enjoyable experience.

I was drawn to Ertilio Namas because I have a love of history and the idea behind the restaurant is taking dishes from Lithuania's past and reimagining them as a modern dish. Each course came with a story that told a little bit about where the dish originated and its importance in Lithuanian history.

My overall thoughts:
A really great value fine dining experience at just €63 for 6 courses. I did find they rushed the ""story telling"" element a little, but they were maybe a bit understaffed on the night I went. All courses were very tasty, in line with what I'd expect from a 1 star restaurant. Sadly one of the dishes I was looking forward to (the moose) had to be swapped to venison as it was mating season, but that's not the restaurants fault.

Dishes in order -

""Chefs Compliments"" - flavours of mushrooms as an appetizer. A very pleasant combination of flavours that set the tone well for the evening. Visually appealing and nice to highlight an ingredient that is so integral to Baltic cuisine.

""Sturgeon, eel, crayfish with beetroot"" - very pleasantly surprised by the subtlety of this dish. I must admit, I'm not the biggest seafood fan, but this was extremely well balanced with the saltiness complimented by the sweetness of the beetroot rose.

""Pheasant as a mushroom - pheasant paté and meat, apples, parsley..sponge(?), rowanberry sauce"". Really enjoyed the novelty of this dish as disguising one ingredient as something else was a big part of Lithuanian upper class culture in the 14/1500s. I would have perhaps liked pheasant in a more ""solid"" form but otherwise very well balanced flavours.

""Beer and bread soup with veal"" - and absolute highlight of this meal, the dark ale and rye bread in the soup combine to make something akin to liquid gingerbread, complimented really well by the richness of the veal. Yum!

""Poularde with swede, carrots, cabbage, and cabbage sauce"" - a tasty dish, this was probably the most forgettable for me. It tasted like what it was, an elevated chicken and veg. Enjoyable, but not really anything I hadn't had before.

""Venison (normally moose) with chard, turnips, and boletus sauce"" - An excellent way to cap off the savoury courses that would only be made better by the addition of moose as an unusual centrepiece. The chard pancake was a nice twist, and the richness of the veal and the sauce was well complimented by the fresh veg.

""Pear with plums, and Jerusalem artichoke icecream"" - another reference to the last with pear being made to look like an apple, the Jerusalem artichoke icecream was a subtle contrast to the sweet and tart notes from the mousse, berries and compote.

Amouse Bouche Pt. 1
In all my life I‘ve never had such tender squid, it felt more like a fish, not a chewy squid, the crisp made out of squid ink even added to the taste. 

Tuna
The tuna was dried, not cooked and the flavour as well as the texture mix between the tomatoes (and the clear tomato juice), chilli oil, basil oil, and tempuras on top was perfect. 

Dessert
Another great, yet classic mix of ingredients, although the rice crispy didn‘t add a lot of taste, only texture. 

The wine pairing was mostly good, out of seven wines, I would have kept four, that truly add to the dish and aren‘t „just“ a wine to the food. Standouts were a wine with a buttery nose which was added to the trout.  Dessert wine was a perfect match, but oh so sweet (144g of sugar).

Service was almost impeccable, although they could‘ve spoken more clearly / loudly in some cases. As it should be, the female was always served first with the wines, then going clockwise around the table. The food was served by equal waiters as guests, at the same time.

1728704216.0,What am I doing wrong in Paris?,"I once had a preconception of Paris as a foodie dream city, but many years of traveling here has disillusioned me and nowhere else outside America do I consistently have such bad, expensive meals (except L'Ambroisie). For context I've been to 113 michelin stars across the world including 28 3-stars and I've enjoyed the vast majority of them or I would have quit this hobby. I do see people speak of and review places in Paris positively so I wonder what I'm doing wrong or what I'm missing. Perhaps my taste is old-fashioned and out of sync with the current fashions. Perhaps I've been to too many top-tier restaurants and I'm growing fatigued.

* Places I've been to:
   * L'Oiseau Blanc\*\*: candidate for worst michelin star I've ever been to. Foul-tasting Japanese fusion.
   * Le Pré Catelan\*\*\*: Simplicity is the secret ingredient of many 3-stars but LPC shows you can go too far. The salmon wasabi dish in particular was a joke, among similar dishes.
   * Le Jules Verne\*\*: another Frederic Anton (LPC) restaurant, see above about too much simplicity, but somehow even worse-tasting and blander. Cod tasted like my college cafeteria.
   * Alléno Paris au Pavillon Ledoyen\*\*\*: lol I'm still not sure what this meal was. Simultaneously too simple and too weird. ""Sauce-based"" but his sauces/extractions are unconvincing to say politely. Managed to make wagyu beef unappetizing. So salty it gave me a cold sore.
   * Kei\*\*\*: technically talented and had a few standout dishes like the miso John Dory and the Spanish beef, but the meal felt like less than the sum of its parts. I feel like French and Japanese fusion are fundamentally, philosophically incompatible after having experienced it at this high of a level and still feeling very unsatisfied. Fusing Japanese lightness and sauces strips French of its very definition and pleasures: its sauces and its richness.
   * Pierre Gagnaire\*\*\*: At the time a decent meal with some inventive techniques (potato ice cream and olive jelly) and tasty flavors (pollock in corn sauce) as my first non-US michelin star, but in hindsight a rather average meal for a 3-star level. A bit conceptually unfocused but nothing bad-tasting and still focused on French cuisine to its credit.
   * L'Ambroisie\*\*\*: Ranks as possibly one of my favorite meals of all time. Chef Pacaud is the most talented chef I've ever eaten with in my estimation. L'Ambroisie is the Parisian exception which makes me feel even more sad because it makes me feel like other places in Paris could do better, if only they wouldn't forget their rich French culinary heritage. Planning to return here next year before Pacaud's retirement.
* Places I haven't been to:
   * Epicure\*\*\* under Frechon looked like everything I was looking for and probably contributed to Paris' reputation, but to my eternal regret I missed it before his retirement.
   * Alain Ducasse au Plaza Athénée\*\*\* looked decent especially given I loved Le Louis XV\*\*\* but sadly also closed down.
   * Plenitude\*\*\*, the new hope for the future, has been frustrating to reserve which has been the main obstacle, but I finally locked down a reservation for next year. I had a great meal at La Vague d'Or\*\*\* in St Tropez so I expect to finally have another decent meal in Paris here.

So basically 5 3-stars and 2 2-stars and most of them strike-outs of varying degrees (except L'Ambroisie of course).

In Paris, the remaining 3-stars (Le Cinq (notably expensive, mixed reviews, horrible meals at people who worked under him), L'Arpege (vegetable-heavy, although some recommend ordering proteins a la carte), and Le Gabriel (new, doesn't seem too inspiring)) don't seem particularly promising. The 2-stars I've been to were so disastrous I'm reticent to try another 2-star in Paris, although I might try Le Meurice just for the dining room, having given up on the food.

Maybe my taste is weird, maybe I'm missing something. Feel free to flame my probably weird opinion. Most helpful if you recommend what I'm doing wrong.",finedining

The food was really good. The value for the meal is great at $180 this is a good choice for a upscale dinner night out. Still some kinks to work out being only 1 month old. 


Upon arrival you are in a waiting area and given a choice of a couple of flavored vinegar based drinks made in house with some shrimp chips/crackers. It was a nice greeting to the night. The dining room itself is nice, and luckily I got a window seat. It’s nice to have a view of the city as the restaurant is on the 16th floor in the heart of ktown. The meal started off unimpressive with the bites and first two seasonal dishes but rapidly picked up to reach the level of food I would expect from this chef given his reputation(he had 2 michelin stars in Korea before moving here). The Jat Jeup Chae, Makgeolli, Saeng Seon, and Gui dishes were the best of the night by far. One thing that was being mentioned by literally everyone in earshot of me was that the time from being seated to the first bites took too long and I agree completely. It was very noticeable. Whichever dish is causing that delay is going to be altered soon. This is the first iteration of the menu for a place 1 month old and so kinks are expected.",finedining

1. Venison broth - rich and meaty, tastes like biting into venison. Bread had an amazing crust!
2. Bone marrow and parsley salad - a bit of work and rather messy but very nice warm marrow combined with salt and parsley
3. Mussels and fennel in green sauce - dish of the night, best mussel's I have ever had in that it was only a sweet taste without that metallic-y mussel taste one usually gets. (hence the half-eaten photo)
4. Lamb offal, bacon and turnip - today's offer was liver, kidneys and brain - strong flavours, bacon was amazing
5. Fish and chips - whole Gunard - tasty fish, strange tartar which was more like an egg yolk salad without much acidity to cut through the general fattiness of the meal
6. Welsh rarebit - first time having this dish, was pleasant enough
7. Madeleines - delicious, warm and almond-y
8. Eccles cake and lancashire cheese - very nice and generous hunk of cheese, the cake itself was adequate
9. Date loaf in butterscotch - very nice, not too sweet at all

Wines - apologies cannot recall, did not order anything particularly fancy

Overall: probably ordered too much so we were stuffed! Could have done 3-5 starters followed by 3-4 desserts, skipping out the mains. Very reasonably priced, all this was £200 including 3 glasses of wine.",finedining

1728557267.0,Japan trip #6/6 Tenzushi Kyomachi,"Forget everything you know about sushi, forget everything you know about japanese hospitality and everything you know about flavour composition.

Because Tenzushi will BLOW YOUR MIND. 

For those that dont know, Tenzushi Kyomachi is considered the best sushiya in the South of Japan, possibly all of Japan. It is run by the most friendly, funny and thoughtful shokunin ive ever met, Amano-san, who is cracking jokes and laughing all the way through service.

From the minute you enter you will experience  the true meaning of omotenashi. They have truly thought about every step of a guests experience down to the last detail. From a little water stream to wash your fingers to the constant change of your hot and cold tea once the ice melts or your hot tea gets too cold. 

You feel like you can leave all your worries behind, lean back, have a friendly chat, laugh, and enjoy some true sushi masterpieces.

Beware, because as Amano says from the start, this is not sushi as you know it (edomae style), this is Tenzushi style sushi. No minimalism, no soy sauce but bold and refreshing flavours including yuzu kosho, sweet kabosu juice and salt. And im not sure if I can go back to Edomae style after this. 

Every piece is like a masterclass in flavour composition, texture and temperature.

The full list of all the pieces are here: 
Akami ( lean tuna)
Otoro ( fatty tuna)
Squid topped with roe and sesame seeds
Kuruma ebi 
Pickled mackerel with japanese ginger and seaweed
Scallops with sweet soy reduction
Dont remember the fish but it was with shiso
Bell fish with ume and baby green onion
Marinated chu toro
Whiting
Aka uni
Smoked bonito with ginger and chives
Turban shell with okra
Grilled shrimp head
Sea bass with liver and roe
Tuna hand roll
Tamago egg
Grapes and melon

Inbetween there was  also dashi soup and dashi soup with red miso

As you can see I had to note them down afterwards from memory because I didnt feel like taking notes, I was there for the ride and what a ride it was.

My favourites were the squid, the marinated chu toro, the mackerel and the uni.

Least favourite was the turban shell.

Overall it was hands down my favourite restaurant ever.
If you can afford it, just go.

P.S. he gave me a signed cd, cant wait to see whats on it hahaha. If youre interested I might give you a peek once im home

1728494137.0,"The Fat Duck (***) - Bray, England","The Fat Duck, one of the nine restaurants in the UK with three Michelin Stars as of 2024, and the only UK restaurant to win the World's Best Restaurant award by The 50 Best (way back in 2005), is celebrating its thirtieth year in business next year. As a result, The Fat Duck's current menu - aptly called 'The Journey' - is a Journey through the restaurant's history, taking in some of Heston Blumenthal's most iconic culinary creations. 

The Fat Duck is an infectious mix of avant-garde cookery (though application of that term may be stretching it now, what with a lot of what Heston worked with some 20 years ago being more readily adopted in the interim) and playful theatre, resulting in a multisensory feast for the senses. While Heston's culinary credentials are irrefutable (he pioneered working with liquid nitrogen, and was an early adopter of sous vide cooking and the use of water baths and dry ice), eating at The Fat Duck is not just a case of 'here's a dish, here's an explanation of the dish, enjoy': almost every course is given showmanship. Perhaps the most iconic dish from The Fat Duck, 'The Sound of The Sea', is accompanied by headphones that play an audio track recorded on a beach. The sounds, the smells, and taste of seafood and brine all do a very effective job of transporting the diner to the seaside (for me, having grown up on the East coast of England, it really was like returning to the place of my childhood. A wonderful experience). Nothing is as it seems at The Fat Duck. Cheese is not cheese, a playing card is the world's thinnest Bakewell tart.

The menu, as well as being a journey through the restaurant's most iconic dishes, is also represented via a figurative spatiotemporal journey, starting off wirh breakfast before heading to the beach, then into the woods, and then to sleep. Of the latter segment, at the end of the show (or thereabouts), you are asked to put on a facemask while lavender and bergamot is spritzed around the table and a lullaby plays as you eat the dish of all-enveloping whiteness that is deceptively texturally varied. All of the theatricality would be moot if the food didn't pass muster, and fortunately it does, though not always to the level of 'Best of the Best' that one would hope for. For every Beef Royal, there is Jelly of Quail that - while interesting - lacks on the flavour profile (with regards to Jelly of Quail, it is the bitterness of turnips that pushes towards uncomfortability). However, while every dish may not hit the heights of what one would expect from one of the world's best restaurants (granted, this accolade was given almost 20 years ago), pretty much all of them have an element of surprise, a means of making you ask 'what's going on there?' Personally, I would rather this - would rather be surprised and stimulated - than be bored. Don't mistake me though: the cooking here is outstanding, but you can tell - via some of the more subdued profiles - that most of the dishes were created some years ago (the crab ice cream being a key example: I feel it didn't blow me away as much as it should. Twenty, even ten years ago it might have, but the world has moved on. Time to not hold back and give us the most crabby of crab ice creams). Would I still take this over most UK restaurants though? Absolutely.

In short, a ""journey"" to The Fat Duck is still a wonderful experience, and one that I would be happy to repeat (particularly for Christmas).

Courses: 
1. Nitro-poached Aperitif ""Lime Grove"" (second picture, with all but the scallop dish being in order via the pictures)

1728476076.0,Royal Izakaya (Philadelphia),"Royal Izakaya is a restaurant with two parts. In the front, the walk-in only main room serves izakaya style dishes. In the back, there are 8 counter seats with two seatings nightly for their omakase with Chef Jesse Ito. When you finish your meal, you're offered a booking 3 months in advance. This creates a strong culture of regular customers but does make obtaining your initial reservation quite tough. It's easily the hardest booking in Philadelphia.

Despite 7 consecutive James Beard nominations, Jesse's approach to the omakase has changed substantially over time, specifically with the use of more plated dishes over the last year. It's really neat to see how much changes seasonally as our last meal in June was his summer menu. This fall menu was fantastic. My favorite part was three different species of mackerel in back to back to back bites, each quite different in taste.

Other little service touches were noted - I was led from my Uber with an umbrella as it was raining. There were dental kits in the bathroom. My name was printed on the menu to take home.

1728394902.0,Japan trip #5/6 Sushi Gosuian 1*,"Sushi Gosuian is the only restaurant on this list that ive previously visited. Thats because it was my favourite sushi restaurant during my previous trip, ranking higher (in my opinion) than many tabelog gold, silver and bronze sushiyas ive tried.

Its run by a super friendly married couple consisting of chef Tsutsumi and his wife, who is an ex pastry chef and now works as the hostess for the restaurant. Tsutsumi is a self taught shokunin that serves edomae sushi  with his own twists and just learned through trail and error. A rare thing in Japan, where most Sushiyas are either led by the son of a shokunin or have studied under some famous shokunin.

Just like last time I walked in and was immediatly greeted by the couple, that recognised me and welcomed me back. It felt a bit like dining at a friends house. While chef Tsutsumi is very focussed when hes preparing the dishes, including a stern focussed look, he and his wife always serve the food with a smile and theyre happy to answer any question or request even though they dont speak english ( but they try).

Regarding the menu, heres the full detailed overview ( sorry if there are any mistakes on how I wrote the Japanese names):

- Flounder sashimi from Nagasaki with menegi ( baby green onion)

- Bincho grilled Nodoguro (blackthroat seaperch) with wasabi, seasoned rice, kabosu and a drip of soy sauce 

- Aorika ( bigfin reef squid) from Fukuoka with soy sauce

- Katsugo ( red snapper) from Fukuoka with yuzu and soy sauce

- 1 day aged botan ebi from Hokkaido 

- Amadai (Tilefish) from Fukuoka in chawanmushi with yuzu. The jelly is made from aged dashi with katsuobushi from Kagoshima and Rausu kombu

- Akami tuna from Aomori

- Chutoro

- Kumamito kohada (gizzard shad)

- Hamaguri (orient clam)

- Aji ( horse mackrel) marinated in ginger and green onion

- Kuruma ebi from Nagasaki

- Smoked Tawara ( spanish mackrel) from Fukuoka

- Aka uni ( red sea urchin) from Karatsu

- Shiitake Akadashi ( dashi with red miso)

-  Hand roll with tuna and pickled radish with super crispy seaweed from Yanagawa

- Warm Anago ( salt water eel)

- Hojicha cheesecake made by his wife

The reason why you dont see any notes is because it was pretty much the perfect meal in my opinion. While my last visit wouldve been a 9-9.5/10, this was a 10/10 for me.
Definitely taking into account the price of 27 500 yen, which for this quality of ingredients and level of technique is an absolute steal.

It is truly a top 3 restaurant of all time for me, maybe nr 1 in terms of flavour and overall enjoyment.

The highlights were the blackthroat seaperch, the Aka uni, the botan ebi and the cake. I know, a dessert ranking in the top at a sushiya is something youll probably never see again but last time I visited I dreamt of their matcha cheesecake almost every day.

My least favourite were the hamaguri and flounder sashimi. But this is mainly due to personal preference and while I generally dislike clam sushi I actually still really enjoyed it this time.

So if youre in Fukuoka make sure to book a spot at Sushi Gosuian. The restaurant is always full of japanese people and both times I was the only foreigner there. 

Its very popular among locals but you can use Jpneazy or Tableall ( if you like to pay extra) to book it. I recommend giving a decent range of dates and being 2-3 months in advance or you might not get a seat.

1728372735.0,Noma Kyoto 2024,"Was fortunate enough to book a table for the first seating at Noma in Kyoto at Ace Hotel. The menu was 15 courses and we selected the wine pairing.  

The experience was lovely and met my expectations. Portions were perfectly sized and I didn’t leave feeling uncomfortably full but instead fully satisfied! The meal as a whole was an ode to fall and had a consistent umami theme throughout. Wine/sake pairings were unique and unexpected, specifically the 2023 Gewurztraminer Barrel Saison.  

I was especially delighted with the sweet oyster dessert that was completely made of ice cream and filled with sweet delights. The chestnut and caviar dessert was an exciting elevated take on sweet and salty “salted caramel” like treats.  

Least favorite (although still enjoyable) was the live kirin-sai seaweed, and most favorite was by far the grilled abalone mushrooms with black truffle “dipping noodle” style with egg yolk with the forest broth and fig leaf leather course in a close second.  

Service was of course friendly and attentive, the excitement for the first day was palpable!",finedining
1728359890.0,Prague and Budapest - Need help picking between Field and Salt,"My husband and I will be visiting Prague, Vienna, and Budapest this winter and want to do two fine dining experiences.

Both Field and Salt have one Michelin star. 

Alcohol pairings are not so important, we usually opt for by the glass. We value good food and service most. A unique experience is a plus (example: Lazy Bear in SF giving diners a booklet with prompts for each dish, simple but so fun).

Chef Hamano trained at Akasaka Kikunoi and Ginza Kojyu in tokyo and then at Sushi Sempachi in kumamoto (both two stars i believe). The whole experience was 19 courses, 5 appetizers and 14 pieces of sushi (+1 extra piece that me and my friend turned down bc we were so full but wanted the last room for dessert), two desserts and green tea to finish.

1728344975.0,Best hotel concierge in Kanazawa for fine dining,"Hi everyone,

We're planning a Japan trip in January '25 and am considering adding Kanazawa to our itinerary. It looks beautiful in winter & there are a handful of stellar restaurants that we're hoping might be a bit easier to book that what we're experiencing in Tokyo. The two restaurants I have my eye on are Sushidokoro Mekumi and Kataori -- but open to other recommendations too!

Hoping to figure out if:

1. My wishful thinking on ease of booking piece might be at all correct
2. If so, if we should aim to have our hotel in Tokyo try to help us with reservations (with the Park Hyatt being under reno we're still trying to figure out what's the best option) OR a local hotel. If it's the latter option, any recs on hotels that might be best suited to help us with this kind of requests.

I was surprised that **Julemont** lost both stars but apparently Guido Braeken left for another hotel restaurant in the area which has not opened yet.

We mostly dined at the restaurants in Limburg last year and I wasn't surprised to see **Rantree** loose it's star. Dined there a few months ago and I think the restaurant space is nice but food wise it was the weakest of the one star restaurants in the region and I would actually prefer many of the lower priced non-starred options in the region over it (**Novo, Enigma, Prix de Rome, L'Echappée Belle, Vanille, Etalage, G7**).

**The Duchess** losing its star is not completely surprising to me. Only visited once but while the taste of the food was good and the location is great, the presentation and refinement were less than what I would expect at a Michelin starred restaurant.

I did expect **Brut172** to get a third star. We dined there earlier this year and preferred it over the 3 star restaurants we dined at so far. The food was fantastic (on a 10 point scale I would say no course scored lower than 9 for us). The location is beautiful and the service was absolutely flawless. Both alcoholic and non-alocohlic pairing were great and the sommelier super enthusiastic.

Would also have bet money on **De Leuf** getting a second star. Probably the best one-star we dined at so far and their langoustine with puffed rice, roe, and vandouvan-sauce was one of my favourite dishes of this year. Their drink pairings and non-alcoholic options are also fantastic.",finedining
1728301331.0,"Accursio (*) in Modica, Sicily: great dinner with an odd final act","We had a very pleasant dinner in Accursio in Modica, Sicily, last week. Overall a great modern interpretation of classic Sicilian dishes and ingredients. The service was exceptional. The restaurant has just 5 tables with only 2 people working in the service, but everything went incredibly smooth. The staff is attentive and warm but not in your face or pushy. The timing of the dishes was impeccable and a special shoutout to Lodovico, who helped us select a Sicilian wine (Primavera from I Vigneri, highly recommended). 

Highlights from the menu for us were the uni/melon sorbet, the eggplant with goat cheese and the lamb with liquid salad. Also easily the best two pasta dishes we ate during our trip. 

The only part that didn’t quite live up to the rest were the odd choices for the final 3 courses: I don’t know if there might be some sort of Sicilian tradition involved in this order of dishes but eating a heavy bread “pudding” with onions after the lamb dish felt odd to us. The dish itself was good, but it didn’t quite fit the rest of the menu. 

The other criticism we had, albeit a very subjective one, were the 2 dessert courses, which were both cream/foam-based without any solid ingredients and felt a bit too gimmicky in their presentation. I can’t even count anymore how many times I’ve been served a ceramic egg in an egg carton in the last few years. This one felt quite well thought out, passion fruit egg yolk and almond “salt” and all, but personally I prefer something to chew on when it comes to desserts. Same goes for #2: a foamy sorbet of coffee, green tea and fruits similar to tiramisu that you had to “smoke” out of the glass pipe. Great flavor, but also lacking something solid to balance out the foam. The praline at the end almost made up for it, though. Modica is known for its chocolate and this little ball of glory did not disappoint. 

Overall, I’d still recommend Accursio without hesitation since the negatives came down to our personal taste. ",finedining

1728266893.0,Chef’s counter at Fort Oak in San Diego ,"I do enjoy going quite a bit to Fort Oak but this was my first Chef’s counter with them. It was $180 for the dinner and $60 for the pairing for a total with everything else of $340. Dinner lasted a total of 3 hours.

Some of my thoughts:

The scallop dish is by far one of the best scallop bites I’ve had. The seaweed butter was insane. Unfortunately, it won’t be going on the menu anytime soon as the chef explained to us that the dish was too difficult to scale up to make into into an actual dish.

The stuffed fried pepper in the wagyu dish was very well executed. And the Carolina Gold hollandaise was awesome. Of course I didn’t lick the dish, but I wanted too.

Everything else was solid but the scallop and wagyu dish were the stars for me.

The pairing is such a good deal. And the pours extremely generous. They kept topping me off.

I love to dine by myself but for those that might not this chef’s counter was one of the more social ones I’ve been to in the States. Would highly recommend it for the solo diner.

I’ve always enjoyed going to Fort Oak and the chef’s counter certainly didn’t disappoint. They won’t have the next one until the beginning of next year but if you find yourself in San Diego I would check it out. At $340 after everything I would consider it pretty good deal for the 3 hours. Maybe a bit controversial but I would choose the chef’s counter at Fort Oak over Jeune et Jolie. Next I’m off to try Valle in Oceanside.

1728261666.0,"Langdon Hall - Cambridge, Ontario","My girlfriend and I visited Langdon Hall for the first time yesterday and the experience was fantastic.

In August, we visited Per Se. Early on in the evening at Langdon Hall, my gf said that she's liking it more than Per Se... I kind of laughed and said don't get ahead of yourself, but as the evening ended, truthfully, I tend to agree with her. Everything was perfect from the food, the wine pairing, the service, the sommelier, the ambiance - 10/10. 

Quite frankly I'm unsure how Langdon Hall hasn't received a star yet. This year they were recognized by the michellin guide as a recommended restaurant, however no star yet. I tend to think this is because Canadian restaurants just started getting stars in the last 2-3 years-ish, but I haven't a clue. I've visited Per Se(***), The Five Fields (*), and Feitoria (*), and honestly Langdon Hall was my favorite experience.

Onto the food, pic 2 is where the evening starts. On the left was a cacio e pepe cracker and on the right a poached sunchoke with saved truffles. Both delicious. That sunchoke 1 biter is one of the best things I've ever eaten. Pic 3 was also served with these two crackers, it was a deviled quail egg.
Pic 4 was a citrus Panna cotta, it was served with the vase in pic 5 - nothing in the vase was edible, it was encouraged to smell the greens in the vase to enhance the Panna cotta. Iirc it was lemon verbana leaves, citronella, juniper branches, and some other aromatics.
Pic 6 is onions and caviar. This reminded me of oysters and pearls from TFL/Per Se. This was an absolutely stunning dish.
Pic 7 is called Taste the ocean, it was a mix of king crab, sea urchin and sous vide scallop is a delicious broth. I've never really enjoyed the taste of sea urchin that much but I really enjoyed this dish.
Pic 8 is juniper smoked trout with a fish skin cracker. Table side the greens are lit with a torch and begins to smoke. The aroma was to enhance the flavors and it worked brilliantly.
Pic 9 is lobster with a crustacean velouté, corn, chanterelle, and a thin layer of sweet corn gel on the bottom. While I've had version of lobster is a lobster sauce many times before this version may have been my favorite take on it. Stunning dish.
Pic 10 is Stracciatella Casoncelli with truffles sliced tableside and a maderia before blanc. Again, perfect dish.
Pic 11 was Lamb belly woth rutabaga puree, and another version of poached rutabag.
Pic 12 was a vanilla semifredo with a consomme of berries and a lemon verbana tuille
Pic 13 was the 2nd desert including some sort of delicious parfait that is sprayed tableside with rose water, and some additional snacks I'd call a maple cannot and a chocolate cookie.

Again, fantastic experience. Will definitely be back. The server Tyler was excellent and the sommelier was super knowledgeable and put me onto some new regions to try and some small batch wineries in the area to buy from. We'll definitely be returning in the future",finedining

1728258072.0,Japan trip #4/6 Tempura Matsu,"Im going to be honest, I booked tempura Matsu on a whim and when I arrived in Japan I kindof regretted it. There were multiple bad reviews online and it looked like a kappo meal with some tempura instead of an actual tempura restaurant. 

I had been trying to book many other tempura restaurants like Naruse, Takeuchi, Kyoboshi and Tententempura Uchitsu but without succes. So I just kindof went down the tabelog list and thats how I ended up at Matsu in Kyoto.

The menu was 39 500 yen so if it wouldve been bad it wouldve hurt a little. But let me tell you, it did not dissapoint.

While it wasnt a full on tempura place I loved the meal. It might not have been my top 3 meals of all time but at the same time I couldnt think of any way to improve the meal. All the dishes were consistently delicious and at least a 7/10, up to a 9.5. I guess its just the fact that there was no ""magic dish"" that left me wanting more.

Heres the overview of all the dishes:
- Marinated salmon Roe with burnt eggplant: Lovely start to the meal 8/10

- Corn tempura with bottarga: super sweet and a nice bottarga aftertaste 8.5/10


- charcoal grilled Yellowtail Sashimi with soy jelly: zoom in on that fish and look at that fat! Honestly one of the best sashimi ive had 9.5/10

- Mackerel with tomato sauce, tasty, 8/10

- Salmon sushi: didnt really fit in the menu for me but the rice and salmon were great. 7/10

- Shrimp and shrimp sauce chawanmushi: one of my favourite chawanmushis, 9/10

- Fish tempura with green eggplant tempura and eggplant egg sauce with truffle: I was shocked when he put truffle on top because I thought it would overpower it all and ruin the beautiful dish but it was a very mild truffle qnd it worked magically. Ate every last bit of that sauce. Probably my favourite dish. 9.5/10

- Rice with otoro and sesame sauce and under it rice with unagi: lovely taste but two times super small, wish I couldve had a couple decent bites. 8.5/10

- Spinach with cured eggyolk and caviar: super tasty. 8.5/10
- Beef and egg with a sweet soy sauce: very nice flavour wise but I couldnt cut the beef so the chunks were too big and clunky kindof ruining the balance of each bite of what couldve been a banger dish. 8/10

- Maitake tempura: love maitake and definitely when its this kind 9/10

- Shrimp tempura: very good 8.5/10

- Mugwort and yam udon: gorgeous dish but hard to eat. Very tasty tho 8.5/10

- Tea icecream with brown sugar sauce: didnt have high hopes for the dessert but honestly tht brown sugar sauce was sooo good. 8.5/10

Overall id give it a 8.75/10. If you want a super tasty kappo/ tempura meal swing by Tempura matsu.

P.S. you might notice my list is out of 6 now. This is because I didnt think Nokishita711 would fit on this subreddit after visiting it. However its an amazing place, 9.5/10 good, basically noma for cocktails. They might not be the tastiest cocktails ever but they will blow your mind and let you experiznce new flavours you cant even compare or describe.

1728241834.0,"House - Brooklyn, NY","I thought I’d post a review of this restaurant since it seems to not be talked about very much online. The dishes are listed in the order they were served.

**Charred Manganji Pepper Crudités (manganji pepper, tofu, chickweed, capers, cornichon, anchovies, olive, walnuts, scallion oil), pictured**: personally, I’m not a fan of peppers across the board for whatever reason. I just don’t taste anything. This is very much me, not them. But the rest of the dish was delicious and the plating was gorgeous, possibly the best of the night in that regard.

**Yellowtail Tartare & Peach Sorbet (yellowtail, caviar, peach, shallot, kale, rice cracker, monaka), pictured**: I will be thinking about this one for a while. Creative with its use of the rice cracker which you’d usually find in deserts. Salty, sweet, the perfect amount of confrontation of my expectations. Reminded me of the Caviar Kim at Jua but three times better (not to denigrate Jua overall; I love that place).

**Stuffed Squid & Cherry Tomatoes (small squid, cherry tomatoes, couscous, red onion, paprika, harissa, coriander, starflower), pictured**: I remember thinking this was solid in execution, but I don’t recall many details a few days later.

**Mozzarella Burrata & Strawberry (burrata, strawberry tuile, pomegranate, blackcurrant sauce), pictured**: this felt more like a dessert course, but given the actual dessert course was also cheese and fruit, it makes sense that they wouldn’t want to sequence them next to each other. If they wanted to lower the price of the menu a little bit, it would make sense to drop this dish, but maybe I’d protest. I loved it.

**Grilled Eggplant with White Miso Hollandaise (eggplant, bottarga, white miso, bonito stock, pistachio, ginger), not pictured**: probably the least memorable of the night for me since it’s pretty similar to something I had at Dirt Candy recently. My dining companion loved it though.

**Red Sea Bream Spring Roll with White Leek Sauce (red sea bream, white leek, spring onion, hijiki, golden mustard), pictured**: didn’t reinvent the wheel, but certainly the most perfectly constructed spring roll I’ve had in my life. Packed with perfectly cooked red sea bream, it’s not the kind of spring roll you just pop in your mouth. Take the photo with a grain of salt—I moved the spring roll a bit before I snapped it.

**Grilled Shou Koji Venison with Mushrooms & Truffles (venison, burdock, truffle, chili pepper, mushroom, truffle, chrysanthemum, soy sauce koji, beef stock), not pictured**: the venison was so tender, it was hard to believe. 

**Eel Pilaf (eel, eel stock, bonito stock, japanese pepper), pictured pre-plating**: what a wonderful way to end the savory courses. Just fills you up with warmth. I’ve read that previously they used foie gras, but I wouldn’t replace the eel with anything.

**Blue Cheese Terrine & Apple Compote (gorgonzola, cream cheese, fresh cream, apple, cinnamon, olive oil), not pictured**: maybe I’m uncultured, but how is this blue cheese? Where’s the blue? Just completely smooth and sweet, pitch perfect way to end the meal. By the end, the dishes were exactly calculated for my stomach. I ate 100% of every course, and while I had no desire for any other food that night, I could still walk home.

I also had three cups of tea as part of the tea tasting (for $50 which I thought was decent): Matcha (Yame/Fukuoka), Gyokuro (Yame/Fukuoka), Japanese Black Tea (Saitama). The black tea was probably my favorite. They also gave us complimentary tea at the end, but I don’t know the details of it.

Service was excellent. We talked to the FOH quite a bit, and they knew so much about what they were serving and they genuinely seemed to love what they were doing (or they were good at faking it). The location is a bit strange, at the back of a shop. We weren’t sure where to go exactly when we showed up a few minutes early. Then 6:00pm on the dot, they slid over a wall, and there was the counter seating. Just enough seating for eight people, very intimate.

It’s extremely odd that they don’t have a star. Personally, I liked it quite a bit more than nearly all the NYC one stars I’ve been to: Casa Mono, Rezdora, Torrisi, 63 Clinton, Gramercy Tavern, and Shmoné (underrated by the way), all of which I enjoyed. It’s closer with Jua and Dirt Candy, but I’d put it ahead of those two also. It’s on the pricier side at $180, but with places like Restaurant Yuu charging $300 now, you could maybe convince yourself you’re getting a deal.

Saw Sixty Three recommended in a couple forums and found same day cancellation on a Friday night. I booked it, put the reservation in my calendar and forgot about it until that evening. Long story short, the reservation didn’t complete on Resy (first time for everything) but the hostess was graciously able to seat us anyway. The space is cozy, service is genuine, and the food was delightful, seasonal and flavorful without being cloying. We had a couple courses of the seven that were less than spectacular but most were, and the menu was a bargain for ~$120 before add ons, and comfortably in American 1 star range. The vibe was very “what’s your special occasion this evening” but would definitely return without one.

1- breakfast taco with uni supplement. Great first bites, familiar individual flavors brought together in a happy taste explosion 
2- caviar handroll supplement. Decadent, glad we tried, but not necessary and definitely outshone by the later caviar course
3- kanpachi and tomatoes. The most surprising flavor combination, which is hard to do for this type of dish (when you dine out enough)
4- lobster cavatelli. Great texture in this one, rich but not too rich. I would eat a whole bowl of this if I could
