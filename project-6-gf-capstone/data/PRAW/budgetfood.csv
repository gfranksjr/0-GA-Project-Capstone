1735956274.0,Beginner budgeter here. Need assistance. ,"I think we can all agree that the prices at the grocery store are hurting us all. Before now, I never had to budget food but we are in a rough place financially. 

How do I begin to budget for a family of 4. 2 adults a toddler and a 7 year old. Both kids are boys and eat a lot. I also pack school lunches due to dietary needs. 

Will someone share where I can learn to budget for food with the high cost of living? We eat everything. We mostly like chicken and ground beef. Almost all veggies. Usually send sandwiches, fruit, chips and veggies for lunches. My husband usually takes leftovers so to have enough dinner left for lunch is ideal. 

I don’t know where to start. We have to cut the budget some how. I spent over 800 bucks last month at one store. That didn’t even count Publix and little runs. Thank you. ",budgetfood

1735877444.0,Ideas for fast and cheap cake/cookies/treats?  Need to make 50 treats a week...,"Hi, I need to prepare about \~50 treats for a get-together that takes place every single week.  For a smaller group of people or if we were only getting together every 2 weeks I'd probably have stuck to cookies, but for this number of people every week I really need to make it even simpler.  Cookies for this quantity/this often is actually a lot of work/time.  EDIT: This is an assigned task I've taken on for the next 6 months and it really will be me alone personally making the treats and they must be sweets, every week, for 40-50 people.

Any ideas for simple, budget-friendly treats I can make?  Ideas so far: Rice Krispies treats are very simple, few ingredients. Same with fudge since it's no-bake.  And ""crack toffee"" with sugar/chocolate chips baked over saltines easy to make at a very large volume quickly.  What else -- other good ideas for no-bake cookies, or simple baked items like the Rice Krispies treats, etc?  TYSM!!!

1735870198.0,Easy soup recipe!!,"I was in a pinch and was craving soup!
I boiled carrots and potatoes in chicken broth (I use knorr powdered bullion and better than bullion) and blended them up. A splash of milk helped with the creamy consistency I was looking for. I added in turmeric and some soy sauce to round out the flavors and to give it some savor towards the end but you can obviously season as you’d like. It’s delicious with toast and I added some beans to my bowl on a whim when reheating and it was super delicious. It only took about 30 minutes too!
Give it a try, this will definitely be in my rotation, I’ll probably use it as a base for other soups and maybe even some baked dinners. 

You’ll need: 
Potatoes, Carrots, Knorr chicken bullion, Better than bullion (chicken flavor), Milk, Turmeric, Soy sauce 

Boil the potatoes and carrots in the broth until soft and blend! Just be mindful when you’re blending so it doesn’t get too watery, add the hot broth in the blender little by little. 
Put it back in the pot and on low heat to thicken
Add your seasonings and milk until you get the desired taste and consistency and you’re good to go!

1735415082.0,Insane how much money I saved this year by shopping at Costco,"We moved to a new place earlier this year, and one of the best perks has been living near a Costco. Before, our family of 6 was spending around $1,600 a month (a little bit over $19,000 last year on groceries). We used to do our shopping at Trader Joe’s and Publix, and then a little bit of Whole Foods here and there. We moved in February and now that we can shop at Costco regularly, we’ve spent just $13,000 this year on groceries (about $1,000 a month). 

It’s kind of crazy how much we’ve saved just by having a Costco nearby. We’re saving 6 grand a year and honestly probably buying more food.

Can you guys help me with a grocery list?,"I really like to cook but living alone I find that when I fill my fridge with ingredients, I can't eat things fast enough before they go bad. I'm a vegetarian (technically I eat fish every so often, but I don't really keep it around at home) and so a lot of my grocery list tends to be produce, which I'm noticing doesn't last. And groceries are expensive these days so it sucks to throw out limp broccoli every Sunday, lol. My method lately has been keeping the fridge empty and making small grocery runs often, shopping meal by meal basically, but my friends think I'm starving when they look in my fridge and I also just prefer having more food on hand day to day.

I'm just wondering if folks can give me ideas on staples I can keep that won't go bad so fast. I get a bit overwhelmed trying to plan my meals for the whole week, guess how long it will take me to eat them, arrange them in order of which ingredients need to be cooked the soonest, etc. What is the solution here? Am I missing something?

1735267133.0,Can you help me find more recipes like this?,"I made this delicious recipe for Mediterranean chicken and rice (recipe in comments) that was extremely easy to make and only involved minimal knifework and my dutch oven. I don't really like cooking lately, but recipes like this make me enjoy it again. Cooking in my dutch oven is extremely satisfying for some reason and I loved how hands-off this recipe was. Can you guys recommend me some that are similar? 

Superficially, what I liked about it includes:

- very affordable (could feed up to 6 people and all of the ingredients cost under $15)
- one pot/pan was used for all the cooking, which made cleanup very easy. Bonus points for using the dutch oven because for whatever reason I just like using them
- very minimal prep work was needed. All I had to cut up was an onion and a zucchini and a little bit of cilantro for garnish.
- It used a good variety of spices and flavors 
- Overall a very hands off recipe. After the prep and the first bit of stirring while cooking the veggies, I just let it sit in the oven for an hour. The taste/work ratio was extremely high. I work 2 jobs so I hate spending time and energy cooking, but I also love food so eating mediocre food is extremely disappointing after a long day.

1735067862.0,Butter was on sale at store today for $3.99/lb - so I made clarified butter (first time),"Think I did okay.  Clarified butter is useful for getting a butter with a higher smoke point - about 482 deg F per web.

INGREDIENTS AND EQUIPMENT 
* 1 lb unsalted butter 
* sturdy sauce pan - I used a 1 qt one 


INSTRUCTIONS 
* take your butter and place in the sauce pan.  I cut the sticks in half or 3rds for the ones on top

* on stove top use low heat and slowly melt your butter.  Do not stir to allow butter to separate 

* once fully melted the butter will separate into layers.  Milk solids will rise to the top.  Skim regularly with slotted spoon to remove.

* this took a long time for me because I was afraid of boiling the butter and browning some of it.  Periodically you’ll get some bubbles to come to the surface- some will be like a little geyser.  That’s okay because it’s water turning into vapor and bubbling out.

* once it looks like the solids are not forming on the surface and the liquid looks clear, strain into a glass jar with lid or another airtight container.  I used a fine mesh strainer but cheesecloth can work too.  Note there will be solids on the bottom of the pot.  Don’t pour that into the strainer.

* you can collect your skimmings and the solids from the bottom of the pan to use elsewhere.  I think these may be needed for making ghee but not sure on that.

1734832602.0,losing my mind trying to make greek yogurt at home,"Ok i dont know what even kind of subreddit to ask this in, but im at my wits end.  
You can buy yogurt and strain it to make greek yogurt, yay. Would save me so much money if i could just figure this out.  
I saw someone use paper coffee filters and a wide mesh strainer online, and for them, it peeled right off the coffee filters, no mess or fuss or anything, just a huge lump of greek yogurt.  
Tried this, and for some reason it makes a thick layer underneath, and then when this thick layer forms, the rest cant get through. this is literally always the problem unless i make a sort of trampoline with a kitchen cloth and a stupidly wide bowl, which takes up a crap load of space in the fridge, whey leaks through the cloth and the whole fridge smells of whey. and also the yogurt tastes a little like kitchen cloth.

I literally BOUGHT a greek yogurt strainer with a little lid to try and get around this fuss, and it doesnt work. the yogurt itself goes through the fine mesh strainer part, forms that little layer of thick yogurt, then stops filtering. I put some cloth inside the yogurt strainer to see what would happen, it worked a little better but the same thing still happens and i just kind of want to avoid cloth all together as its such a hassle.

1733117081.0,The Worst Turkey I Ever Roasted out of 36 years,"I had the worst turkey dinner of my entire life. Let me state I have been roasting turkeys for 36 years. All but my first one which admittedly was overdone and dry have been moist tender  birds with beautiful browned skin and a pleasure to carve. This includes 6 wild turkeys I personally harvested. Most all the birds averaged more than 20 lbs in dry weight. This week's bird weighed 19.66 lbs.

I treated this bird the same as I have done all the others. It was frozen so took 4 days in fridge to defrost it. Took it out Thursday morning and washed the bird off inside and out.

Patted it dry then wiped a bit of olive oil and butter mix on the skin and applied simple salt and pepper seasoning. Seasoned the inside similarly.

Set it in a roasting pan on a rack and added a butter and broth mixture to the bottom to baste it with and to mix with drippings for gravy.

Roasted as usual being careful not to dry it out basting it regularly. It was done and at temperature 15 minutes earlier than anticipated removed from oven and placed on a platter and wrapped it in a tent of foil for it to finish and to let the meat rest.

Now all of my turkeys have been delicious and moist and tender and easy to carve. 

Notice the picture above, that was the brand and type used this week.

First the bird was like carving styrofoam board. That dry and tough.  The only moisture found in meat on this bird was in what was in contact with drippings and it was tough also.

My question is this, is there some special way you should roast an ""Organic"" turkey. 

I ask as I am worried I might have done something wrong here but reviewing my process In did not deviate from what I have done in the 35 birds previous to this.  The meat was dry and tough like the slabs of jerky you buy at the gas station. Except the jerky was chewable.

The meat from this turkey is so tough I can not use it for sandwiches. The white meat is like stringy cardboard and the dark meat is worse.

Anyone with experience with this brand and type of turkey please chime in on your experience with it and any ideas.

I appreciate it.",budgetfood

When it was done, I took all the meat off, and put the bones, gristle and skin back in the pot. Added another cup or two of water, and put it back on to high pressure for 90 minutes. Afterwards, I strained that and put it in the fridge beside the meat.

Today, after going for a short adventure to the beach, I used about half the chicken, half the stock (now beautiful golden jelly), and half the fat (collected from the top of the stock), plus some leftover/frozen veg, to make a truly yummy chicken stew that I served on some mashed potatoes. And because everything that went in was already cooked, it all came together in about 20 minutes. I blame the potatoes for taking so long.

Maximum value for minimum effort, and minimal cost. Fed five adults for about $7 ($1.40/ea).

Chicken - $2.50 (includes bonus stock and fat)

Carrots - $1 max

Tonight I was trying to recreate something I had made previously that ended up much closer to a soup, and accidentally ended up with something felt more like a stew.  The up front cost may seem a little high depending on your preferred ingredients (I live in the midwest, arrived at $22.45 ignoring sales and accounting for unused ingredients), but by the time cooking is done it fills a 6 qt crockpot and it's decently filling--my leftovers filled a large casserole dish and about half of a medium-sized tupperware container.

But I will let the bulk cool out and put them in the fridge. Here they last a few days and they are a great base for some quick meals: 

Breakfast potatoes: just dice a few of the baked potatoes from the fridge and fry them up in a pan. Add some onions garlic paprika and whatever other leftovers you have, like sausage or meat and add a few eggs in the end. Cheap and powerful breakfast. 

Potato salad: just dice the baked potatoes and add some mayonnaise, onion, gherkins and paprika and you have a quick potato salad. 

Hash browns: just shred them in a bowl and combine with some flour, egg, salt, pepper and spices. You can even add herbs or cheese. 

Twice baked potatoes: just soup them out, fill them to your liking and quickly heat them up in the oven or microwave. 

Potato burrito: Mash, shred or just cut the baked potato and fry in a pan with some eggs, cheese, bacon and other available leftovers. Fill in a tortilla. 

Potato soup: just peel and blend the potato with some broth, milk and seasonings and you have a simple potato soup.

Loaded potato skillet: cut the baked potatoes up and saute with some onion, garlic, peppers and other available leftovers. Then top with cheese and eggs.

1 lb Ground Beef
8 oz Tomato Sauce
½ tbl Onion Powder
½ tbl Galic Powder
1 tsp Chives
1 tsp Parsley
½ tsp Thyme
1 tsp Savory
1 tsp Salt
1 tsp Pepper

Brown ground beef with chopped onion until onion is soft and meat is browned.

Drain off excess grease from meat.

Add celery to meat with carrots and potatoes stirring together.

Add 2 cups of broth to mixture stiring together.

Add savory, chives, onion powder, garlic powder, parsley, thyme, salt and pepper. Add fresh or frozen green beans. Stir into mix well.

Add tomatoe sauce and rest of broth and stir together with other ingedients. Bring toa hard simmer the turn down. (You may have to add extra water to make sufficent soup liquids. Add 1-2 tbls worchester sauce (add drained can of green beans if using here) stiring in well.

Let set on low simmer for a few hours to cook vegetables. When vegetables are cooked taste if flavors a bit bland add a tsp or so of either lemon juice or vinegar and stir.

Serve with bread.

NOTES:
If you do not have celery you can use 3/4 tsp of celery seeds ground up for celery flavor.
Optional: I save left over vegetables such as peas, corn, and green beans to be used in soups add them for a more substantial soup when you add final broth.

This recipe scales up or down very well.
Freezing well potatoes get a bit mushy but okay otherwise for 2 to 3 months

Yes, it’s an absolute disgusting disaster. (To be clear, the county’s treating our homeless population like an intrusive herd of deer is the disgusting part, not the homeless folks).

My org already serves most of the homeless population, with some folks already stopping by every day. We are a doc office and offer hot coffee, cold and hot water, and will put out food if we have it.

I’ve been trying to think of food items that are soft, cheap, have a decent shelf-life, and don’t require cooking appliances. 

So far what comes to mind are foods that can be made in a cup with hot water (oatmeal packets, ramen, maybe something like the Kodiak power cups except not a billion dollars) or things that can be made with minimal materials (could have stuff for pb&j but need to refrigerate jelly, might not be the most hygienic to have a community jar of PB)…

I just found out a friend of mine hasn't eaten in a week because an emergancy hit and now she can't afford to feed both herself and her kids. She normally makes enough to get by, its just a string of bad luck.

I am going to drop $500 on food for her. I'm trying to figure out what the best combination of shelf stable foods will give the best combination of nutrition and diverse meal options for her.

My current tenative list is canned chicken, canned tuna, pasta, brown rice, beans, a few gallons of olive oil, a few bags of onions, and some freeze dried crushed garlic. The problem is I'm not sure what exactly you can make with that, I feel like I need to add a few more things to the list that will allow everything to be used together instead of just a bunch of random unrelated ingredients.

Can anyone recommend both any staples to add to the list and recipies that can best utilize the cheap foods with minimal extra expenses? I'll also be giving her a crock pot I was given a few years ago to make cooking easier.

1730813803.0,Really easy Shreded chicken for multiple meals.,"Hi

Often recipes for shredded chicken are not much more than simmer it in some stock cube/stock, or worse just boiling water. 

These two 350gm breasts cost £1 each.. That's pretty cheap in the UK. 

I like to make shredded/pulled chicken as it stretches alot further. 
From the pictures you can see I have enough for 4 individual pies, some for sandwiches and a decent amount to use in a two person meal. 

Obviously you can use more or less, stretch with extra veg and my seasoning is just my prefenace. Mix it up how you like but I'll give you a run down of what I did. 

1 teaspoons of Old Bay 
1.5 teaspoons of Vegetable stock (I'm not sure how wide available that brand is, it's polish I think but in the UK most supermarkets sell it. It's amazing.) 
0.5 teaspoons of garlic granules (not powder) 


Give the chicken a pat down with kitchen paper to make sure it's dry. Give it a spray or rub on some oil just lightly. 
Season both sides of the chicken and (in my case using gloves) rub the dry rub all over. 


Cover it up on a plate and put in the fridge. Ideally for 2+ hours but it's not one to leave overnight so maybe make in the morning and cook after work? It works too if you only have an hour. 30 minutes is the shortest time I've let it marinate.. It was still good. 


Anyway. Get a pan onto medium hot (not searing), a few sprays of oil or a small amount if your not spraying. I put both large breasts into the pan and just leave them alone. Don't move them, poke or prod. Give them 4-6 minutes to get some color and they will easily move when you shake the pan. 

Turn them over for another 4-8 minutes (the pan has cooled by now and it needs longer to brown the second side) and be ready with some boiling water. 

As the chicken was seasoned with veg stock there was no need to use a stock to poach the chicken. 

Once the chicken is browned on both sides and there is some yummy seared goodness on the bottom of the pan pour in the boiling water. It's going to bubble, steam and then you'll notice all the caramelised goodness lift off the pan. 

Next part is easy. Just use a wooden spoon or whatever you have to scrape up all the browned bits of flavor. (wooden or silicon won't sctrach your pan) 

Pop the lid on and leave it for 12 minutes.. Yes you have to use a timer, I do at least or I forget what I was doing. ADHD brain is a hazard, ha. 

Once it's done I check to make sure the thickest part has got to 75c (Sorry don't know that in f) and put them into a air tight container to rest. 

If you are using the chicken for a meal immediately then let them rest for Atleast 10 minutes. 

I left mine for an hour then took two forks to them for shredding. 


I have turned £2 worth of chicken into four individual pies (obviously extras will be needed), Atleast the three sandwiches I've made and enough to give my dog a little treat. 


(I did try to make a pie but wasted some chicken as I had a temor and spilt sugar into the pan, ha!) 

I'll post how the pies comes out tomorrow. ",budgetfood

Any little bit helped at the time so I was downloading all of them but now that time has passed I have weeded out the bad ones and the good ones are what is left. Do what you want with this info I just wanted to help save money on groceries 
 
Receipt Scanning/ E-reciepts / Cashback Apps - Favorites Last to First

Rakuten - 8/27/24 () $ 10.80 This one is a cash back app alot like Honey (which gives you cashback and finds you Coupons and promo codes) I just got it last month and got 12% back For a $100 Oil change. The cash out is every 3 months and they just drop the full amount it in your account on 2/15, 5/15, 8/15, 11/15.

Honey - This app I've had since 2015. Originally It was just on my PC but I use it to find promo codes for everything. It also has cash back for quite a few places. I couldn't tell you how much I've made honestly Since January of this year I've made $38.40 Cashback and countless promo codes lol

Frisbee - 1/13/24 $32.17 I do like receipt scanning apps some are a little slow to pay out, most of them give you more payouts the longer you use. This ones the slowest but still simple with no ads and the cashout works.

Ibotta - 6/14/24 $9.75( pqcbrsy ) This one is a cashback app. Look up the item on the app, select the cashback for the items available. Then just scan your receipts Or sometimes the item. I had this one in my extreme couponing era. It's pretty good.

Receipt Hog - 1/12/24 $26.55 ( gak28203 ) Its acute app Easy to use  It's not the biggest payout but if Im snapping pics For other receipt apps might as well for this legit one too well worth it. The payouts work

Receipt Jar - 1/12/24 $37.18 ( HOPEPJ128 )This one gives you more the longer you're a member but for a lot of the Ereceipts you need to refresh the Connection once a week or so. Just do it when you snap pics of your paper receipts though and it downloads them with the correct points.

Coinout - 6/14/24 $ 20.75 Very Quick money took me less than a month to reach their ""Diamond level” which just means a higher payout for each receipt and bigger rewards. I haven't had it as long as the others but it's up there in my Favorites. It's also got as low as $3 payouts

NCP - 8/30/24 $ 25.35 I had applied to be on this one at sometime this year and got on a waitlist. I heard about the National Consumer Panel in my couponing days but never applied. I do like this one. It's not scanning receipts though. It's scanning barcodes and entering amounts. I will say it does take a little longer for Big shopping trip but it's kinda fun to me. So to each their own

Fetch - 4/13/24 $109.70 ( TP41AA ) Wow love this app. Just try it for real. They give big bonuses for a lot of stuff!  They have cash back for items. It has a Fun interface. This one I wish I had found sooner! Love this App 5 stars. They even added some more cash back and rebates for delivery items. Use my promo Code for a fat welcome bonus too! So so good ❤️ 👍

Chop the following into chunks:
A leek, an onion, whatever carrots you have, a sweet pepper and any mushrooms you have. I was luck enough to have some forest type mushrooms as they where on offer. 

Put it all onto an ovan tray and use a bit of oil, some dried herbs and mix. I did add a cheeky dash of smoked paprika, ground nutmeg and and a little onion powder. I did add about a 1/4 teaspoon of tomatoe paste too... 

Be aware I'm cooking for someone with oral cancer so soft/puree is heaven for her. 


Into the ovan for 45 mins at about 190c, tossed once half way through. 

Then all into a large pan to get to a high heat. I poured over some homemade chicken stock and left it all to mingle for 25 minutes. I added  a bay leaf first. Then a can of condensed mushroom soup and a few chicken bones from another night's meal. 

Once it was all done I put it in the blender (minus the bones) for 10 minutes. While it was on I added some cream (again free for helping out my neighbour as she had left over) and let it blend for another few minutes. 

I put it back into a pan to make sure it was hot while I cut a couple of bread rolls. I put some butter in the pan, a halved clove of garlic, black pepper and let the bread toast.

1729692504.0,Help with meal inspiration please? High protein,"I intend to try jamming together lunch and dinner to one meal with about 40g protein. The idea is to do an intermittent fasting regime based on eating early in the day so I get better utilization of the energy according to the circadian rythm. It´s also strategic because the few times I do overeat it´s always in the evenings and I want to lose a bit of weight.  
But I am trying to stick to a tight budget and an issue is that I only have 30 minutes lunch and am not a 'volume eater', my gut likes 'normal' or 'small but satiating' better. But yeah, I aim to try it anyway. Thought it could be good to know so people don´t think that I consider an almost OMAD-supersize meal good, quite the opposite or it would have been easier to load up on protein. My food budget for the whole weeks lunches is 15$.

Ideally, I would be able to meal prep the weeks 5 lunches at once, but have some 'extras' ready to make the dish a lil bit different towards the end of the week. Like a different sauce or side veggie/carb or something.  
I aim to cook gluten free and mixed vegetarian/animal based foods because my gut can´t deal with enough beans and such at once but only meat would become bad quality or expensive on my budget. Also good amounts of fibers, complex carbs, good savoury taste (so I do spend some on seasonings/sauces and sometimes find it worth to add a lil bit extra to the budget if it´s for a nice seasoning). I have a Cosori Dual Blaze Airfryer and a Crockpot express (so pressure cooking + slow cooking) and I love to use them when possible.

So far I have come up with this meal from mostly foods I already have got at home;

Chicken inner filés (frozen 700g, 140g protein), with 5 dl of red lentils (dry, 40g of protein) that I mash so they are sort of disguised in the dish, figured it would be easier to eat in one sitting, served with oat rice the first 2-3 days (so another 4g protein/day from the rice on those days)  and then I come up with something else as a side such as brussel sprouts/zoodles. The idea is that it´s gonna be a pot with coconut milk, spices, onion, some veggies such as bell peppers and carrots. Divided into 5 portions, in case that was not clear.

Some other foods I already have that I would love to come up with recipes for;  
\- Small white beans  
\- Yellow peas  
\- Sausages (it´s just 10g protein/100g sausage, swedish 'Falukorv', pretty neutral taste)  
\- Black beans (was thinking about trying them as a base for gluten free pie crust)

So yeah, for a total of at least close to 200g protein and 15$ for 5 portions, gluten free, healthy, not too heavy to eat for a small eater in less than 30 min and best case scenario ideas for variation towards the end of the week. Thank you in advance for any input! (:



\-UPDATE-   
I got a lot of inspiration from just the few current posts in combo with the list of ingredients that I have. It´s so valuable to hear how other people are thinking! Currently, I actually think I have roughly enough for the next 4 weeks worth of lunch boxes. 

1. The meal I wrote in the initial post (chicken stew with lentils, coconut milk, oat rice etc)  
cost: about 7$ mainly for veggiesand coconut milk + food I already have  /7$

2. Oven sausage with 'regular' household cheese, custard, tomato puree, fried eggs, boiled potatoes, baked cabbage or such (cheap veggie).

I have the rest already, got some really cheap sausage that I put in the freezer last week (800g for 2$). /17.65$

3. Pie with crust made of white beans, tuna filling (canned). There are actually a lot of fancy ingredients I need such as sun dried tomatoes, feta cheese, corn, canned tuna, (eggs but I would have gotten them already), it´s supposed to be creme fraiche but I would sub it for cottage cheese, I already got beans and other but I would buy tuna 3,20$, sundried tomatoes 1,90$, feta cheese 1,90$, canned corn 1,30$, cottage cheese 2,70$  /11$ 

4. Soup made with a big bunch of white beans and tomato sauce. I already have beans and crushed tomatoes. I´d be using leftovers of the cottage cheese above. I´d make fry bread out of oat meal flour and psyllium husk which I have got already. I´d make scrambled eggs on 8 eggs which I have gotten already above.  I´d use a semi-fancy sausage on campaign price, cognacsmedwurst 2,60$ for 350g for some additional foodiness and flavor (I´d be using about half of it), + leafy green salad 1,60$  / 4:20$

So sure I already had a bunch of the ingredients since last month but \~33$ for 4 weeks seems promising. It´s not the entire months food budget, but not far from it actually... Pretty cool!

$1.79-1 lb celery package 
$1.19-thyme seasoning
$1.19 parsley seasoning
.89 -seasoning garlic powder

$4.05 42 oz old fashion rolled oats 
$2.48 32 oz container bone broth

Optional ingredients:
2.65 2.8 oz of garlic stir in paste
$5.19 32 fl oz Apple cider vinegar 

Optional add ons: fried egg, beans, cheese (

$19.30 total cost USD at Aldi for all ingredients (each of the seasonings mentioned are .75 ounces) 
-total cost for ingredients WITHOUT garlic stir in paste and apple cider vinegar: 11.50 

Ingredient ratios (yields one serving):
-1/2 cup oats
-1 cup broth
-1 stalk celery
-1 handful spinach 
-A few dashes each of garlic powder, parsley, lemon pepper, oregano, thyme
-Dash/less than a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar (optional)
-Small dollop of garlic stir in paste (optional)

Directions: 

1. Put 1/2 cup of old fashioned rolled oats in a bowl, followed with 1 cup of bone broth (chicken or beef, can substitute veggie broth or veggie stock, as well as chicken broth/stock or beef broth/stock) 
2. Add several dashes each of garlic powder, lemon pepper, thyme, oregano, and one stalk of chopped celery 
3. Optional ingredients-add a dash (less than a tablespoon) of apple cider vinegar, and a small squirt of garlic paste (you can just use a lot of garlic powder instead-I used the paste and apple cider vinegar because I’m feeling under the weather)
4. Stir together well, cover, and put in microwave for two minutes (you can cook them on the stove if you prefer/do not have a microwave) 
5. Chop one two green parts of the stalks of one green onion, and chop a handful of spinach 
6. Stir into bowl, heat again for 30 seconds in the microwave 
7. Top with/add any additional ingredients on hand of your choice, such as a fried egg (that you can make before or while oatmeal is in the microwave or on the stove) and/or cheese (I used mozzarella), or even canned beans (I would cook or just heat those up before adding them to the oatmeal) my beans of choice would be chickpeas or black beans, and cans of those at my Aldi are about .89 each I think )

Additional math/making it last info: 

If you use a 1/2 cup serving of oats each time, with a 42 oz container you get about 60 servings, if you do a full cup of oats instead you’ll get 30. A single 32 oz container of broth will yield 4 cups towards 4 servings, so you’d need about 15 total containers for 60 1/2 cup oat servings. You can cut that in half by using just a half cup of broth, and a half cup of water instead of a full cup of broth.  Also if you find it hard to use up leafy greens like spinach before they wilt/go bad, taking half of the bag and giving it a quick rinse in a strainer, patting the leaves dry, and tossing them in an even-ish amount into a gallon freezer ziploc bag to freeze helps me with that when I have time ",budgetfood

I made it tonight with a pound of 25% off ground pork ( so maybe $4?) and some rehydrated shiitake mushrooms I have on hand.

Basically, you mix the pork with seasoning until it resembles a paste and add chopped up mushroom and just steam it.

Recipe as follow:
1 pound ground pork
4 dehydrated mushroom - chopped very fine
1 Tb oyster sauce
A dash of soy sauce
A dash of sugar
A dash of white pepper
Some sesame oil
1 tspn or so corn starch
Some water

Mix the ground pork with the seasoning and mix in the mushroom. You can definitely mix up the cake in the morning and let it hang out in the fridge until ready to cook. Make sure you use a rimmed dish

When cook- set up steamer on high . Put the dish in to steam for 15-20 min.

I just eat it over rice. That is enough for a family or a big meal with some leftovers.

* Remove steaks from pan and rest on cutting board up to 10 minutes.  I sliced the steaks for serving to stretch them.


Potatoes
* Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  

* Take 4 to 5 russet potatoes dice medium like in my pic

* in a 10 by 17 glass baking dish add the diced potatoes and toss with olive oil.  Can add melted butter in if you wish 

*  Apply spices.  I used a spice mix of paprika, salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder.  For spice mix ratio it’s 2-2-1-0.5-0.5 respectively.  I make a lot at one time and keep in a shaker.  Also add dried thyme to your preference

1728998531.0,I had *some* left of beef shin stew and made it stretch into meals to freeze! ,"I recently posted how I made some rich beef stew. I had alot of left overs, as intended and had a plan. I did forget to post how it looked served up for the first meal so picture two was the first two meals which where way to much for each of us. 

So onto the left overs! I heated the stew back up the next day and to make sure it was a one container frozen meal I added some frozen peas, string beans and a can of cannelloni beans. It was what I had in the freezer and cupboard that my mum can eat, having oral cancer. You can add whatever you have or enjoy. 

I went to the shop and got some potatoes and onions as again I had run out. 

As mash doesn't really freeze well (for me) I sliced the potatoes into thinish slices and dumped them into cold water. Put the hob on low and braught to a low boil. You can salt the water (I prefer to) but I need to keep salt down for mum. 

Once the water is gently boiling I gave it a few minutes and then drained them whilst running a cold tap to stop them cooking more. I wanted them firm but par boiled enough they won't be ruined with freezing. 

Once cold I cut the slices in half and layered onto the stew. I almost ran out but managed to get a single decent layer. 

As I had used the same herbs in the stew I decided to grab the last of my garden herbs which admittedly aren't great right now but free. Gave them a chop along with the onion into small peices. 

Sprinkled on a bit of the fresh thyme and rosemary on each container, shared out the red onion between each and then some parsley. 

Basically done. I labeled the lids so mum knows what she's getting out of the freezer. 

All she has to do is take them out of the freezer the day before, put them in he ovan at 180c for 20 minutes with the lid on, then 20-30 minutes with the lid off. You *can* cook from frozen but i prefer to defrost in the fridge the day before. Mum tends to just take them out of the freezer and straight into cooking. As the stew was cooked long and slow, the meat doesn't need softening however it does need to be at a decent temperature.. I'm over cautious. 

I intended these frozen meals to be stand alone dishes, with he amount of meat, veg and potatoe but they can also be halfed when cooked and shared between two with sides. 

I hope you're having a good day! 

As a point of reference the entire 8+ dishes came to under £1.50 each if eaten as is. With the amount of stock, meat, bone broth, veg and the cheeky glass of red wine, I don't think that's too bad. It's cheaper than a micro meal and alot healthier, in my opinion of course.

The one thing you should know is I like to cook 'on the cheap' but since I'm cooking for my mum with cancer it has to be somewhat healthy. So here is how I made some beef stock that's going to go into a healthy, rich beef stew using shin meat as it was the cheapest cut of meat! 

The pictures tell you pretty much everything I did. I understand things better in pictures. 

The beef bones are from morrisons and surprisingly a good amount of meat for making stock. £5 in total, not too bad. 

Gave them a good bit of seasoning with what I  had in the cupboard so: 5 grinds of salt, about 10 grinds of the mixed pepper (use any you have), 1/4 teaspoon of dried rosemary and 1/2 teaspoon of dry thyme. I gave them a spritz of oil too before mixing it all together. 

The veg is self explanatory but there were 3 gloves of garlic for good measure.

Then into the combi ovan at 190c for 30 minutes, turn everything over and back on for another 20. 

I used about 200ml of boiling water from the kettle to deglaze the ovan tray, all the best bits   got scraped and made a very thick and oily mess! Sounds gross but it's amazingly tasty. 

I put it all into a pan with a tiny peice of cinnamon (2cm long), one half of a star anise, some fresh rosemary, and parsley from the garden. 

Then the only thing to do was add as much cold water as needed to cover, put the pan over the small hob burner on low and leave it alone! It's been on for most of yesterday and all night and the house smells amazing.

1728558804.0,$20/week Chinese Bao or Dumplings,"Ingredients (Canadian Pricing):

$7 Ground Pork (500grams)
$8 worth of vegetables (either or in combination of cabbage, spinach, green onions, carrots, mushrooms, leeks, etc). 

$15 per week (+$5 per week flour/seasoning/yeast, etc)

—

Vegetables portions should be 2.5kg or more (usually opting for whatever is on sale to expand the filling portion to meat).

This allows for 4-8 big dumpling or bao per day (2 cups of flour).

The ratio of meat to vegetable filling is 1:5 (but can scale to 1:10 if budget is constraint). 

The 1:5 scale gives it a meatier taste.

1:10 scale will be more vegetarian, while the small amount of meat acts more of a seasoning/spice agent (the fat and meat for an umami or a savoury taste). 

—

Dumpling vs Bao: the only difference between these two are cooking method and the addition of yeast to rise the dough or not. Dumpling can be steam like Bao, but are often pan fried, steam in the pan, then refried for a golden crust. 

—

Quick Instruction:

1. Combine 2cup of all purpose flour into large bowl
2. Add in 1tsp of baking powder (for dumplings) or 1tbsp of activated yeast (for Bao).
3. Add in 3TBSP of oil
4. 1 cup of warm/hot water
5. Mix until sticky dough appears
*Restrain from adding too much flour, as a stickier dough is better, and will become less sticky as you knead it. When rolling out the final dough for dumpling or Bao wrapper, you will be using more flour to prevent it from sticking to the roller or table, so you don’t want to over flour the dough at this early stage due to that.
6. Knead the dough 100 times or for 5-10 minutes. You can add flour if the dough is too sticky but with caution.
7. Let rest for 30 minutes (dumplings) or 1 hour (Bao). Difference is that yeast in Bao requires more time to activate.
8. Quickly knead dough after resting a bit, then split into 8 smaller doughs (1 cup = 4 Bao or large dumplings). 
9. Roll out into circular wrappers, using flour to dust the roller and table to prevent sticking.
10. With your finger tips, wet your tips and dab the small amount of water on the edge of the flatter dough wrapper. This is to help it stick together when wrapping the dough to the final form.
11. Put in filling and wrap dough (video tutorial online for various versions of wrap are available).
12. Steam for 10-15 minutes.

1728484481.0,Chicken and mushroom soup with pan seared garlic bread,"My mother isn't well (cancer) and wanted something warm and filling and I need to keep the costs down soo.... 

I got some vegetables: Mushrooms, a white onion, a red pepper and some celery. I had half a red onion in the fridge. One garlic clove for good measure. I'd have liked a carrot or two but the local shop didn't have any. 

Gave it all a chop ready for cooking. Then onto the chicken! 

I have some chicken breasts frozen individually so I plucked one out and defrosted it in the microwave (I didn't have time/foreplanning to let it defrost overnight) whilst chopping the veg. 

I cut it into very thin strips, gave it a spritz of oil and sprinkled 1/2 teaspoon of mustard powder, 1 teaspoon of old bay seasoning and a good 'eye balling it' 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper. Then just gave it a good mixing on the chopping board, making sure everything is mixed well. 
I did put some cling film over it while it was waiting to be cooked, but the vegetables need to cook first! 👍


I oiled up the pan that was on low and threw everything but the mushrooms and garlic in. Quick few stirs then ignored it while I watched a movie for about 10-15 minutes.. I got distracted but that's ADHD for you 👍
Now that it was starting to cook nicely I gave it a stir, left it for another 20 minutes. 

Once the base veg got softer and had nice crispy bits in went the mushrooms with more butter than I care to admit, also 1/2 teaspoon of dried thyme. Mushrooms seem to suck up the butter while they get rid of their moisture, so I let the whole lot cook for a while. 

Into a bowl once the mushrooms had little crispy bits and were not rubbery. 

Chicken bits into the pan next in batches, when slightly browned they go into the bowl with the veg. Once the last batch of chicken is cooked I turned the hob onto max for a minute sor it was very hot the added 250ml of chicken stock made from asda/Walmart cheap chicken cubes. Gets all that cooked goodness off the bottom of the pan, and saves washing up! 

The last bit of the soup is easy, put in a can of condensed mushroom soup. Stir, simmer for along as it takes to make the side. 

I'm not sure what bread this is, it was £1.20 for 6 rolls. It made at a localish bakers, tastes and has the mouthfeel of home made bread and normally costs £3 a bag. Bargain. 

Sliced them open and gave them a little rub of butter to get them going. Once they were a lightly toasted I rubbed a cut garlic glove all over. On went a good amount of butter and a stinking of mixed herbs. Back into the pan they went for about ten minutes on high heat, turning often.

1-2 potatoes each. Make sure you poke holes into the potatoes and microwave for 10 minutes. Type does matter but as long as they fit in you hand it's fine. 

While that's happening grate some cheese. In my case I had some red onion too so I sliced two very thin slices for 4 potatoes. Sliced them into small bits. I didn't want to waste what onions I have. 


Once the microwave was done I scooped out the potato flesh and left the skins intact. Made a few tin foil things to put the skins in.  I gave them a spray of oil, vegabtle in this case, a small amount of salt and lots of black pepper. 

The skins went back in the air fryer on its max setting for 10 mind while I sorted the filling. I was ready for them in less than 5 so it just kept the air fryer ready. 


I mashed the half cooked potato with the cheapest cheese I could buy and added onion. Put the mashed spud mixture back into the skins and I saved some cheese to put on top too. 20 in at 190 in an air frier and done! 

Yeah it's baked potatoe but when you can and want to do something different, it's very enjoyable. ",budgetfood

I made pan gravy from the dripping.

*Yes, I will share my food, but not for free.  Pay me back in cash or kind.*

A market 2 miles from us has whole chickens on sale for 99¢/lb this week, so we can restock easily.  I'll probably get extra for the freezer. 

I also made chicken stock from chicken spines, giblets and bones I'd been saving in the freezer.  There's crockpot soup in our future.  I filled 2 12-cup containers, with some left over for making my gravy.

My neighbour is very elderly and needed some help with her bins and some cleaning. 

She was trying to give me money but I didn't take it, she's definitely not short on money but I couldn't take cash for helping. Instead she offered to make me dinner. As she struggles to see I offered to cook and the food would be more than enough payment. 

So onto the recipes. Please keep in mind I'm happy to chat and relax while food is on the go, so 1 hour cooking just onions is no hassle for me. My neighbour just lives a chin wag so she was happy while I did my thing. Q


I used what she had in the house which is more than what I normally have, so it was fun and a bit luxurious for me. 

Sliced 1 very large mild yellow onion, 4 white cooking onions, 3 red onions. 

After my eyes stopped watering, I melted about two tablespoons of butter in some olive oil. In went 1 bay leaf, 1/2 teaspoon of dry rosemary and 1 teaspoon of dry thyme. I gave it a good 5 minutes to melt and get the herbs fragrant. I didn't have fresh. 

Then it's just a case of throw in all the onions. Mix so everything is coated in herby oil and put the hob on its lowest setting. Gently cook the onions for much longer than you think is needed, then cook for longer. That huge amount of onions cooked down so it didn't cover the pan. Lots of sweet, charred and jammy onion goodness. 

Whilst that was all happening on it own, with the occasional stir, I peeled and boiled the potatos she had in her cupboard. Gave them a good mashing, added some cheddar cheese and butter. She came in and said mash always needs mustard... She put a hefty pinch (or three) of Coleman mustard powder in, and I'm guessing 1/4 teaspoon of white pepper, and the same with black pepper. 

So after a break to stir the onions again I put half the mash into a foil lined tray, put a sliced up ball of asdas cheapest mozzarella on too., some Asda cheapest mixed herbs and covered it with the rest of the mash. 
On top I put one sliced tomatoe, more mixed herbs then some grated cheese. 


Now the cheese and potato pie is ready for the ovan, back to the onions. 

In went a tablespoon of plain flour whilst stirring then gave it a few minutes to cook. 

Now that the onions where browned, and starting to get jammy I cheekily put in a glass of her red wine. I don't like wine but she does, so seemed to be a decent option. It was maybe 200mls, I guess. I used a beef stock cube to make 500mls of stock, added it while stirring.

While that pan was gently bubbling away I peeled and cut some carrots to boil. Put some frozen beans and sweetcorn into a pan, and remembered I hadn't put the sausages on to cook. 

Popped them into the air fryer, 200 for 18 minutes. Once done I put them into the onion gravy mostly to stay warm while I put the cheese and potatoe pie in the ovan for 25 minutes on 230c. 

I did taste test the sausage and onion, added 1 teaspoon tomatoe puree, 1/2 teaspoon of sugar, a teaspoon of the vinegar she had and a teaspoon of marmite! 

All in all it's a very rich, warming and filling dish made for my neighbor and I put the leftovers into tubs so she has food for a few days. 

I just wish I knew how to plate food well and how to take pictures. Oh well, free food for helping someone, huzzah!

I’m using ground cumin and coriander, cayenne, salt, and a bit of smoked paprika. Then I’m adding garlic and sautéing til the chopped garlic is fragrant. Then I’m adding my soaked lentils and water and cooking. When it’s done, I’ll use my immersion blender to blend it up and eat with croutons on top. I know it calls for parsley but I don’t have that and I’m not going to the store.

I’m sure it’ll turn out amazing - it’s basically garlic and potato soup with lentils to add fiber. I’m very happy to create a twist on this Lebanese recipe. All power and love to Lebanon and its people. ",budgetfood

Heat oil over medium heat and cook onion for a few minutes. Add pork and turn heat up to HIGH. Cook until pork is mostly done/mostly gray-ish. Dump all remaining ingredients in, stir until mixed up and then don't stir at all for a minute or 2 until the bottom starts caramelizing. Toss and then let cook without stirring for another minute to caramelize again. Repeat until as crispy as you want.

I put this into 4 bowls over plain rice. Then I cooled the frying pan back down to medium and tossed cabbage, carrots, yellow squash, and red peppers for a few minutes in the leftover oil until lightly cooked. I salted and then dumped the veggies on top. I'm so excited for lunch this week! Total cost approx. $3.50 for just the pork, approx. $8 for the full four bowls.

Bean and rice are the cheapest option.



Butter, flour, milk and process cheese creates the nacho cheese.

Flour, oil, baking powder, water to create the tortila.

After trying many dishes, even more expensive meaty dishes, this seems to pack the most flavor, lowest time to create and cheapest.

It's extremely cheap.

$15-20 a week can get me:

$6 = 1kg of red kidney beans dry. (last 1 week)

$5 = 2kg of rice (last 1 week)

$3 = 1Litre of heavy cream 10% (last 2 weeks)

$5 = 14 process cheese (last 2 weeks)

  
MISC: = Taco seasoning, Bag of flour, baking powder, canola oil ($20-30 for the month).

  
Step 1. soak and boil dry beans, then smash for refried beans.

Step 2. Butter, flour, milk then 3 process cheese slice for nacho cheese.

Step 3. Cook rice.

Step 4. Make simple tortila

I managed to get 6 chicken thighs for £3.00, a jar of Asda basics korma sauce for 75p and used what I had to make a meal. 

What I had in the cupboards: 3 small sweet potatoes that have been in the cupboard for 4 months but had only just started to sprout eyes. 
A bag of frozen peas. One red onion. Various spices. 


I'm currently caring for my mum and due to tongue cancer and related issues she can't eat anything 'spicy' (that means salty, acidic, chilli pepper heat, black or white pepper and no garlic...) 


So into the pan went 1 red onion in a little oil for 20 minutes, stir when it starts to catch.. Basically when it starts to smell good. 

I take the onions out of the pan when using thighs as they take a good long cook to be tasty and tender enough. 
So into the pan with the meat in batches until sealed, I'm don't want it cooked at this point. Once all of the meat is sealed then in goes the fun part. Take the meat out. I rarely measure anything but because of mum I didn't want to over do things sooo.... 1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika, 1/4 teaspoon ground corriander, 1/2 teaspoon cumin. I don't have fresh garlic or ginger but had a small amount of mixed I froze so added maybe a teaspoon. 

Give it a few second/minutes to cook the spices into the oil that's left into the pan. 

Put the meat and onions back into the pan once the seasonings get fragrant and stir. Nothing fancy about this because in comes the cheapest sauce you can find. If you know Asda/Walmart korma sauce it's not pleasant but added to thigh meat it's OK, with spices it's half way tasty! 

Throw in mouthful sized chunks of sweet potato. 

Give it 15 minutes with the lid on, stirred once or twice when you remember. Give it a taste for salt and put the lid back on for another 20 minutes. 

10 minutes before your ready to eat throw in some frozen veg, in my case peas. 

May not look much but it's meat, potatoes and veg in one pot on the cheap!

I'm asking for ideas because I don't have regular access to a fridge or freezer. I'm in a roommate situation where they only let me use the top basket in the basement freezer, and I rarely get fridge space. I also tend to easily forget what food I have in the fridge, so sometimes food will go bad before I remember it exists. 

Is there any way to make full meals without refrigerated or frozen food? And if so, can y'all help me figure out what I should be buying and making?

Edit: Thank you so much everyone! I wasn't able to get everything I wanted, I had to put back an onion and a couple cans of soup, but that's fine because I found a 4 for 5 deal on veggies, and a lot of sales were going on at the time. 

I just made myself a microwaved baked potato (nothing fancy, butter and some cheese, no sour cream) and I'm feeling more secure about being able to eat.

I buy food (chicken/ ground beef/ sausage) on a Sunday afternoon with plans to use it on Tuesday/Wednesday. I get stuff with a decent expiration date, put it in the fridge as soon as I get home with no side trips. About 40-50% of the time, the meat turns and typically ruins dinner plans and leads to take out or replacing it the day of, breaking the budget

This feels like a relatively new thing, like over the last year or so. Am I being stupid and doing something wrong? I don't want to put stuff in the freezer if i am going to use it 2-3 days later.

1726441943.0,Do You Find It Economical To Make Your Own Baked Goods?,"For me, it depends. And we'll define baking in the broadest sense as using any kind of flour to turn it into a ready to eat food.

Sandwich bread: from a strictly sticker price POV, no. There's white bread at Aldi that's $1 and whole wheat that's $2 ($4+ at other stores). But I'm using better ingredients and making a higher quality food. I've also made a small chunk of change from turning it into a side business.

Pizza dough: absolutely. My most lavish pizza comes out to $6 with all costs included. A cheese or veggie pizza on tomato sauce is around $4 give or take 50 cents.

Subs & Hamburger Buns: by a slight margin, but it's not worth the time commitment IMO. I don't really eat subs or hoagies that often because I don't need that much bread. When I make turkey Burgers I usually use the brioche buns at Aldi that are $0.75 each.

Sweets: I don't eat that many sweets, and it's usually a smoothie rather than a solid food. But I occasionally make peanut butter cookies and it's a reasonable cost.

If you know how to bake or at least did a cost-benefit analysis, is baking worth it to you from a sticker price and/or quality perspective?",budgetfood
1726437032.0,"Sausage, mash, sweetcorn, greenbeans and a really nice mushroom and onion gravy. £3 for four meals. ","I'm not sure if this is a bit of a cheat, I'll explain why. My friends partner works for Asda (Walmart) and did the mark downs yesterday evening. My friend got a text from him that there where some really cheap foods going just as she happened to leave work. 

She turned up, knew where to look and grabbed some really reduced, still in date food. She messaged me this morning telling me she got some bargains, as she knows I'm really struggling with food, and offered to bring some round. 

I got a pack of 6 good quality (for Asda) sausages, half a cauliflower, a pack of chestnut mushrooms and a pack of shitake mushrooms. She also picked up 4 ready made beef stocks that are in a tear open top bag and gave me one. I tried to give her some cash but she giggled, saw my change tray and said ""this is enough, I think I made a profit!"" and left. £3.50 was in that tray, as I'd counted it a few days ago. 

Ended up very gently frying 3 onions for 30 minutes, added the mushrooms for 20 minutes then added the beef stock. Lid on for 20 minutes to simmer with some dry herbs from the cupboard, while the potatoes boiled for mash and sausages in the air fryer. Just added some cornflour to the stock as it was rich and I don't have flour in at the moment. Made such a nice gravy! 

I made up the plate in the picture but it was far too much for me (there's three sausages on the plate). I actually made two plates, one for me and one for my mother but we both ended up putting what we couldn't eat into containers. So easily 4 meals, for our appetites! 

I had onions, potatoes and frozen veg, and  basic dry herbs/seasoning in the house.

1726245490.0,"Update to $86 food haul, made gravlax with the salmon","1. Spread out plastic wrap, 2 pieces, so you have like a 2ft x 2ft square

2. Spread the cure on the plastic wrap, I used sugar and salt in a 2:1 ratio, some recipes say 1:1 but I think it's too salty. Idk how much I just eyeball it so there's a layer the skin side of the salmon can rest on it. 

3. Cover the top with the cure and you'll be making lox. If you take the extra step and season it, you'll have lax, I think, idk, I'm not any of the races that make these things so that's my understanding. You can add gin, ground pepper, fresh or dried dill. Or not, the important part is the to cover the flesh side of the salmon with the sugar and salt so it covers the entire flesh side and remains visible. Whenever you can't see salt and sugar on the fish then you need to add more. I don't have exact portion because I eyeballed it. 

4. Wrap it up, poke corners in the Saran wrap packet so liquid can leak out. I used the Tupperware in the picture because the center is warped and raised up higher than the sides so the liquid can pool along the edges. I take one of those cheap disposable plastic water bottles with the tiny caps and I drink half of it and then take the air out and molded the bottle to the shape of the fish and then put the lid on with rubber bands. This way there is pressure on the fish. I guess to remove more liquid? I'm not sure, the recipes used things like food cans and wine bottles but I don't think that's practical. Anyways fish packet, water bottle, Tupperware lid, another water bottle on top of the Tupperwareid and some rubber bands to keep it together and to add more pressure and put it in the fridge. 

5. I drained it and checked on it every 12 hours. One recipe said 36 hours for medium cure and I think that's the sweet spot. After 24 hours it definitely was cured but not quite enough for me, still had raw texture. If you can't see any salt/sugar on the fish then you need to add more to keep curing it. I dumped out a fair amount of liquid at first and it slowed down each time I checked the fish (once every 12 hours). 

6. I filet'ed the meat off the skin and then charred the skin in a toaster oven. I cut up the charred skin to make into crumble to add smokey flavor to the final product without actually have to smoke anything. 

7. Bagel, toasted, schmeared with cream cheese, put capers on a plate and then press the cream cheese side into the capers so they don't fall off, add think sliced lax/lox and red onion, squeeze of lemon, fresh dill... You can add cucumbers but I prefer not to.

1726244129.0,One pot meal takes 5 min to prep,"We get busy and buy more expensive convenience foods.  Which are usually more fattening too.  So I have found making a one pot meal can save me money and time cooking and cleaning up.  This easy cheap thick stew really checks all the boxes of fast, easy, nutritious and budget friendly.  These ingredients prices are from my local Walmart and will probably be different in your local market. 

Beef Veggie Barley Stew 

The main ingredients are:
A pound of 90% lean hamburger (800 calories $6.98)
32 ounce package of great value frozen mixed veggies (550 calories $2.48)
11 ounce box of quick barley (1190 calories $2.74)
2440 calories ÷ 18 one cup servings = 136 calories per cup
Cost $12.20 ÷ 18 = 68 cents per cup 

Seasonings:
1/4 teaspoon rosemary
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
Beef bouillon and Mushroom Umami Seasoning (sorry I don't have a measuring as I just add to taste) 

I make it in my ninja foodi, but you can just use a big stock pot. 

The interesting part is you do not brown the meat!  Just using it to make a collagen full broth, so not breaking it down in the meillard process.  Just mix a few cups of cold water into the beef thoroughly.  Then add the frozen veggies.  Add enough water to bring it up to the 18 cup mark (if you're using a stock pot, I'd estimate you'll be adding 3.5 quarts of water.)  Add rosemary and pepper before cooking but no salt or bouillon.  I pressure cook for 30 minutes just to speed up cooking the frozen veg, but it's not necessary as you can just bring it to boil and then simmer for about 30 minutes. 

Then add the barley, and although I use the steam function for 12 minutes, you can just simmer it. 

Add some bouillon and mushroom umami seasoning at the end instead of salt.  It adds more flavor and less sodium overall that way.  The seasonings add the ""browned"" flavor, so i don't have to brown the ground beef, which creates a really rich unctuous broth. 

I have added a few handfuls of crumbled up shiitake mushrooms in the beginning when I add the veggies but it's not necessary, but is a low calorie add in.  If you invest in a big bag get stemless, and you can use bits of it in many recipes and that makes it economical.",budgetfood

Parameters: I’m cooking for four, there are dietary / sensory stipulations - no beans, rice is okay in small amounts or if in a casserole or something. Veg has to be cooked (salad is okay sometimes but other veg needs to be cooked), and sadly (for me anyway), nothing spicy. 

Also I’m burnt out AF hence the easy / quick aspect. 

I feel like I’m making the same six things over and over and that’s okay in some respects but looking to add a few more affordable options to the rotation! 

Edit: changed the post flair - but in case a budget is still needed… under $15 a meal would be good. Under $10 would be even better. 😅",budgetfood

1724645489.0,Barter for dinner!,"I scored some 84¢/lb chicken legs from my local ShopRite recently.  8 legs have been in the fridge marinating in a combo of soy sauce, lemon juice and olive oil.  Tonight I roasted the first four over a rack, (400 F for an hour) with quartered Russet potatoes and baby carrots.  The veg was tossed in olive oil. I used poultry seasoning, kosher salt, black pepper, Old Bay and some thyme as seasoning.  I made gravy from the pan drippings. \[Use the recipe on the Argo cornstarch canister if you don't know how.   I used chicken stock rather than water.\]  I also was steaming some wild rice in the rice cooker and had some leftover dirty mashed potatoes to nuke.

While I was setting this up one of my housemates asked if he could get in on dinner. He offered to provide me with a 14 oz/414 ml container of *Häagen-Dazs* cherry vanilla ice cream. \[$3-99 a container at the local ShopRite\]   A deal was struck. 

After I loaded our plates I put the other 4 legs in to roast along with another pound of carrots.  Now I have protein for 6 dinners in the fridge along with sides. I could always make more trades. 😉 

My housemates aren't mooches.  They will usually leave me in peace while I cook.  Offers of extra pizza slices are not unusual. One guy used to bring home the excess bread and pastries from his old job.  We did our best to eat all that before it spoiled. 

Who else barters dinner? \[Or takes cash contributions?\]

In these costings and recipes I haven't added the spices and seasonings I've used as I think it varies a lot from person to person and most things can be adapted from what you have in your cupboard

**Sausage and cheesy mash** - 6 portions £1.43 per portion ^(/ £1.85 ready meal version)  
12 (posh) sausages \[tesco\] £5 ^(/ could get the cheaper sausages at £1.50 for 8)

200g grated mature cheddar \[tesco\] £1.59 ^(/ could buy a block of cheese and grate it yourself for it to be cheaper)

**'Breakfast' Hash** - 4 portions 96p per portion  
8 pork sausages \[tesco\] £1.50  
800g potatoes \[tesco\] 27p ^((2kg bag £1.35)) ^(/next time i make this i will definitely add like twice this amount of potatoes, the sausage to potato ration at the moment is very generous so would definitely not feel lacking to spread out over more portions)  
250g onions \[tesco\] 25p ^((1kg bag 99p))  
half bag of frozen peppers \[asda\] 80p ^(/ already had these in the freezer, would buy fresh next time)  
2 large free range eggs \[tesco\] 62p  
50g grated mature cheddar \[tesco\] 40p

**Sausage and Egg 'Mc'Muffin** - 12 portions 76p per portion - ^(/ £2.79 McDonalds)  
12 english muffins \[tesco\] £2.40  
12 'plastic' cheese slices \[tesco\] 67p ^((15 pack 83p))  
10 large free range eggs \[tesco\] £3.10 ^(/ you could get caged eggs and make it cheaper but i personally don't)  
16 pork sausages \[tesco\] £3 ^(/ i just take the casings off and mix up the meat to form in to patties)

1723702134.0,Budget tips,"Please note that I am in the US and I am giving advice from my knowledge of shopping here. I apologize if this isn't wanted. I wish to help others so you can take or leave it. I wouldn't say I am the best at this but I have stretched our food out with my family of weeks without going to the store aside from the occasional milk or sandwich bread. 

These items I like keeping in stock or on hand: Tomato sauce, dried noodles, dried rice, caned cream soup (chicken, potato, mushroom), shredded or block cheese (if I'm desperate I shred my own cheese), tortillas, eggs, bread, broth powder (I have a large container from a local Asian market), canned veggies, boxed stuffing (I make casseroles or crab/ salmon cakes with this), boxed pancake mix (freeze your extra waffles or pancakes), boxed potato flakes (great for thickening soups), curry/ white/ and brown cubes (sure you can make your own curry sauce but the cubes I found at the Asian market are so simple. White/ brown are stew cubes), tortillas, butter, gravy (I buy the gravy packets), bread flour (sometimes I make my own bread as a side with meals
(Leftover bread is either made into stuffing or chopped into cubes seasoned, baked into croutons and frozen). Many of these I buy on sale. 

Prepping can take up a chunk of time but will help in the long term when you are short on time. I try to buy meats on sale. Buy family packs, divide, bag and freeze. Buying whole turkey or chicken when it goes on sale helps. Debone and freeze parts of it for later. Raw hamburg doesnt seem to freeze as well for me so I either make patties, or meatballs and freeze. 

Veggies I buy in bulk and freeze. Carrots or celery can be shredded and frozen, added to any dish. Onions or mushrooms can be chopped and frozen. Both lasted me for several months and were only $3-4 for bag. Peppers can be chopped (or cored if you make stuffed peppers). Corn (when in season) can be cut off husk and frozen for meals.You can even freeze bagged spinach if you use it for pasta or soup. Potatoes are different. I make mashed or twice baked and freeze them. Fruits (berries or apples), I buy in season and freeze. Sealed shredded or block cheese and lunch meat can also be frozen. So can sandwich bread, bagels, muffins.

Last tip is shopping. Early morning shopping is great for deals. Eat before you go, look at sales, compare prices. Sit down, make stock of what you have. Try to shop if you are in that area. Budget stores can be great for basics. Make a list and price point. If I'm really in a crunch, I take a calculator so I know I don't go over board. Leave room for taxes if you have them. Also take a look at marked down items and use apps if you can.

Lastly, if you cook for yourself or make a large batch of something that you know you can't finish, freeze it. Got that left over bacon that you wont use? Freeze it. Don't force yourself to eat the same thing if you can. Just put it away for another day. Don't throw away money. I hope this helps someone. ",budgetfood

I am Italian and I grew up on “fagioli all’uccelletto”. I’ll share the recipe cause I eat this weekly and it’s a tasty and cheap meat alternative lunch/dinner

1- Dry beans (pinto are recommended but I did it with all kinds, the result is very similar)
2- Canned tomato chunks/sauce (whatever is cheaper/have at home)
3- Steak herbs!!! (Sage, thyme, oregano, rosemary, whatever you have at home, fresh or dry) plus some garlic (better fresh but whatever you have at home will do)

Soak the beans for a day (change water when it gets too dark/murky), after that boil them for 40/45 minutes. On the side cook down the tomato sauce with some oil, garlic and the herbs. Once the beans are ready, strain them and add them to the sauce, cook it all together for 10/15 minutes adding some salt and pepper.
I eat it by itself with a piece of buttered toast or with some oil!

I made a quick easy  ""cheesecakeesque"" filling using cottage cheese that is actually pretty tasty. I made it because I wanted a quick easy creamy cheesecake filling/pudding but didn't with the summer heat and bing lazy didn't want to mess with ovens, beating eggs, sugar etc.

Im not going to say it's ""healthy"" or a replacement because it's dessert. I used regular cool whip, 4% milk fat cottage cheese, whole milk and regular pudding. If you are watching your fat and sugar intake, you may want to change ingredients for sugar free, fat free version.

1721296171.0,Dhal: food of the poor or food of the gods?,"You cannot get a more budget food than dhal and rice and I would choose it over some really fancy curry a lot of the time.

Dahl is so easy and tasty that you will be amazed you have managed to live your life without it. I was!

In it's simplest form it's just 1 cup dried split lentils to 2.5 or 3 cups water or stock (just a stock cube in hot water; again optional as lentils have nice flavor already).

Red lentils and mung dhal have different flavor, and it's good to try all kinds of dhal. Chickpea is one of my faves but you have to cook it much longer if you want it less chunky. 

I forgot to state how important it is to rinse the lentils. Some don't do this, but I was taught to do it till the water runs clear.

You can cheat that by boiling them for a minute or two, then rinsing, then putting back on with fresh water too.

If you are using green lentils make sure you pick through them when you are rinsing, as very occassionally there will be a very hard lentil like a stone in there, and you don't want to bite that when you're eating!

Not sure what those are, but I've found a few at times, and they are rock hard. They sink to the bottom of the rinsing bowl and tend to be darker than any other lentils.

An onion is standard at least in Western dhal versions, and shouldn't really be skipped, but if you don't have one...yeah well. Ideally a chopped onion in there.

You can also grate in a carrot, or stick in big chunks of it if you like to mix up the texture. Zucchini chunks? Yeah! Why not. Bell peppers? Why not!? Whatever you have.

Add garam masala (mixed spice) right at the start and cook for 15-30 mins, depending on how hot your stove is and how you like the texture. Some like it smoother, and some like it so you can still see lentil shapes. Your choice. Try both. On a reheat you will get the chance to cook it down more.

This is also the point to add a chopped fresh chilli, or some chill powder or flakes if you want any heat in it; this is entirely optional.

Once the water has mostly absorbed you will have to stir it quite frequently and turn the heat right down.

I usually like dhal pretty thick, but your preference might differ.

Before taking it off the heat, you can stir in a bit more garam masala or spices of choice to your personal tastes and to freshen the spice of the dish.

Chillis, chilli powder or curry powder is entirely optional if you don't like hot spice, but I'd recommend some.

Serve with long grain rice and you have a tasty filling meal in half an hour.

I think you will be absolutely shocked by how good dhal is considering what it is made of.

I would leave it as simple as that since you are on a budget, but if you can splash out a bit for more luxury, you can add a knob of butter, splash of milk or cream or yogurt or (for pure decadance) coconut milk, all of which can be stirred in right at the end when it's cooling.

Garam masala is the cheap spice option, but you can add ground ginger, ground coriander, ground cumin and a pinch of turmeric (also fenugreek is used to sub for onion if you are following an ayurvedic diet) if you have those things handy and want to try a slightly different flavor profile.

Roasting the seeds yourself and grinding them...yeah ok, it's budget food. The stuff in those little jars and packs is well good enough, but the fresh roasted and milled seeds are next level ;)",budgetfood

1721261057.0,Lazy Chicken Tiki Marsala,"Hear me out: this was great. So I’m on a bit of a budget and saw that Indian Tiki Marsala sauce was on sale at food lion. $3 for a jar.

I also grabbed one of those easy Rice packs (herb and butter) for a dollar.

1 Green and 1 Red Pepper for $2 (only used half of each).

Chicken Tenderloins were on sale ($6 for 1.5 lbs).

Here’s what I did:

- Baked only 1/2 of the Chicken seasoned with salt, pepper, old bay (I’m from Maryland, sue me), oregano, and hot sauce as the binder

- Cooked the Herb and Butter Rice Pack

- Once Chicken was done, sautéed the peppers for a bit (I like them crunchy), added the Marsala sauce, rice, and chicken at a Medium Temperature until hot in a large pan.


Now I don’t know if the Indian I’ve bought where I’m located is bad: but this is near comparable. I still have 1/2 of the chicken tenderloins and 1/2 of each pepper. I have A LOT of leftovers and should last me another day or two!

For $11 and 2-3 days of Marsala (with more tenderloins in the freezer). This was amazing.

Hope someone finds this helpful :)

1720745985.0,Let's talk about milk,"Let's talk about some tips for saving money on milk.  I have some tips to share, and I hope I'll learn some new ones:

Buy half and half instead of milk.  It's fairly inexpensive, it keeps in the fridge much longer than milk, and you can add water to it to make it more like milk.  Really great when you usually only need milk on hand to cook with and therefore go through it very slowly.  The upside is that you have cream on hand to make fabulous sauces and other recipes where cream works better than milk.

Freeze milk you might not use in time.  You can use ice cube trays, though I use my silicone egg bites mold to freeze a large cube of it that's roughly a quarter cup of milk.  Once frozen, I put them all in a labeled bag.  I take out however many needed for a recipe, put them in a glass bowl, and micro them for 30 seconds at a time until melted (or put them in the fridge to thaw the night before, but I never remember).

Buy powdered milk.  When I used to only very occasionally use milk to cook with, I sometimes bought powdered milk to have the ability to have milk on hand at all times without waste.  It's not cheap to buy a box, but it goes a long way and keeps a long time.  It's also good for those that have limited or no options for keeping food cold or for storing frozen extra milk.

If choosing between types of milk, consider that you can often buy whole milk for the same price as skim.  You can add water to get it to the taste/consistency of skim, 1%, or 2%.  That stretches it, making whole milk a better deal.  It's also more calories for the same cost, which might be a consideration for some.

That's enough from me.  Do you have any other tips about saving on milk, cream, or plant-based milks (almond, soy, coconut, etc.)?",budgetfood

Ingredients:
- 2 cups of cooked rice (preferably day-old)
- 1 tablespoon of oil
- 1 onion, chopped
- A handful of curry leaves
- 2 sausages, sliced
- 1 egg
- 1 teaspoon of chili flakes (adjust to taste)

1. Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and curry leaves, and sauté until the onion is translucent.
2. Add the sliced sausages and cook until they start to brown.
3. Push the sausage and onion mixture to one side of the pan and crack the egg into the empty space. Scramble the egg until fully cooked.
4. Add the cooked rice to the pan and mix everything together.
5. Sprinkle in the chili flakes, salt, and seasoning cube. Stir well to combine all the flavors.

But…I have never in my life cooked or eaten lentils.  Is there anything I should know?

It just says “lentils” so IDK if they are green or brown, not red. Probably brown?

I don’t particularly care for soup - in general, and especially in this heat.

1720051687.0,bootleg shakshuka,"Hey everyone, I'm waiting for it to cool off right now though I've had a few bites and I've made the most dumbed down bootleg version of shakshuka, all in one pot, here's how I did it:

I have frozen zoodles on hand but I'm sure any noodles or rice you want will do (ideally pre cooked). I defrosted the zoodles with some olive oil in a pot to thaw them out. This would be where you'd sautee any veggies/aromatics you want in olive oil, I know people like bell peppers and onions (I did add some garlic myself)

Once the zoodles were dethawed (so veggies cooked to your liking), I didn't have crushed tomatoes on hand but I DID have some No Name garlic pasta sauce on hand, so I dumped that in (I'm sure if you're using other noodles/rice/etc you'd add it around now-ish? Or sautee it with the oil depending on what you've got). I chucked in some frozen spinach (seriously, don't sleep on frozen veggies!!) along with onion powder, cayenne, paprika, freeze dried chives, and the obligatory salt and pepper. Really any spice would be good here.

I let that bad boy simmer for a bit, and then I cracked in two eggs. I covered it (well, kinda, I kept the spoon in the pot to prop the lid open bc I'm paranoid about things boiling over lol) until the eggs were poached, and all was said and done.

It might be somewhat of a sinful version of it, but this ""shakshuka"" tastes pretty amazing (seriously, tastes better than it looks) :D Don't mind my messy table lol

All of us are working adults (I'm the youngest at 21 y/o) so we'd prefer quick and easy meals. We have access to many devices, including an air fryer, blender, stand mixer, instant pot, and rice cooker. Recently my sister and I went to a local South Asian market and got loads of lentils, gram beans, and rice for cheap. We have access to a lot of different spices, so we could just live off of lentils and rice with various spice blends but we also like variety. If it matters, we have a membership to Costco and are also on a CSA share at our local farm so technically we prepaid for a tonnn of fresh veg when it's in season.

The parameters:  
-I have a peanut allergy, and my sister has a tree nut allergy.  
-While the rest of us are okay with them, my autism causes a texture aversion to eggs. I'm only okay with small bits of them in fried rice. Things with egg \*in\* them are fine, but I struggle to eat anything as eggy as/eggier than French toast.

She's freaking out and complaining that she's going to have to feed all these people. I told her I can't go buy anything, I'm broke but I can make chili and cornbread, so she's going to buy hot dogs and buns, crying the whole time about having to spend her money. Y'all were right, her circus, her monkeys. 


So a couple of months ago my roommate and his girlfriend decided they were going to throw a small get together at the end of this month. What started out as maybe two dozen people has ballooned to about 60 people. These guests were told to BYOB and bring a chair and a dish pass. This crowd - a lot of them are perpetually stoned old hippies and not very responsible for lack of a better word. A lot of them are going to show up without bringing food. I am literally having nightmares that there's not going to be enough food.  I have $30 and what's in our freezer and pantry. I have 3 lb of hamburger, 3 lb of sausage. Two packages of chicken, 4 pkgs of bacon, a pkg of ground turkey, four boxes of rotini noodles, three packages of spaghetti noodles, about six cans of diced tomatoes, 4 cans of chickpeas, a couple cans of black beans, a couple cans of corn, a can of peas, a couple cans of cream mushroom soup, 1lb of rice, 2lbs of flour, a giant box of jiffy corn bread mix, and two boxes of Ragu double cheddar sauce, 2 fresh cucumbers and 2 green peppers, a 3lb block of cheddar cheese, salsa, cottage cheese, Italian dressing, ranch dressing and 3 dozen eggs. I have two 6 quart crockpots and a 3 quart crockpot.  What would you make? 

I'm thinking about cooking up the hamburger and sausage together and making sloppy joes. I was also thinking about making a fiesta chicken casserole with the cheese, beans, corn, rice and diced tomatoes.

2 cups of broccoli coleslaw or any coleslaw for that matter (mine was from a bag)

Oil for frying at least 1/2 inch in a skillet (I used my little deep fryer cause it was 4am and I was grindingly tired but I normally prepare it this way) or use enough oil to deep fry to save time

Water/milk/almond milk/liquid similar to water (I used water)

Take coleslaw, mix with flour/starch mix, get oil 350degrees or hot enough that when u drop a piece of the slaw it begins to bubble but not sputter with smaller explosions, make into a good 2” disc about 1/2”-3/4” wide (Eyeball it I did.

Downside is its quite expensive and time consuming to get, and prepare food. Positives are I have never felt more energetic in my life, and my chronic back pain has gotten better.

I have been thinking about ordering catering from a place like subway or Chipotle and freezing most of it to make for most of my meals, as It should be cheaper then normal, and much easier.

My current restrictions on my diet are no gluten, no dairy, no sugar, with some lite exceptions here and there.

The two options I have though about are getting a subway wrap platter, but I'm unaware if they have gluten free bread for the wrap, I Also can't find an option to pick up the order myself.

I have the same issue with Chipotle, on top of that I'm pretty sure it might be more expensive to order it catered then separate.

Just looking for any general advice, especially when it comes to catering or other cheap ways to get lots of food.",budgetfood

I recently started working my job as a young adult. I’m looking for suggestions for cheap lunch items I can bring to work. I started buying Wendy’s fries on break when I didn’t have a plan and I’m looking to save money, Because going to Wendy’s everyday isn’t cost efficient.

I only have 15 minutes of break so preferably something easy to prepare (if I need to prepare it) that doesn’t need to cool too much.

1717955404.0,Tips For Someone Chronically Hungry?,"TLDR: I've been eating mostly whole foods, but since I started working out I'm hungry all the time.

I ate a lot as a male teenager (typical), and my appetite declined in later college years. Within the last year, my appetite has become more demanding than ever before.

Most of my meals are 30-40 grams of protein. The biggest change I've made in the last year or two is switching to cook mostly from scratch and with whole foods.

The only reason I grab takeout is when I'm away from the house for hours on end. I was never able to find a job so I Grubhub, and if my stomach is growling with 2+ hours left I usually grab takeout. Otherwise I eat at home.

Other than that, biggest change I've made within the last 3 months is starting to work out, and that's when my appetite soared.

My typical plate includes an animal protein, some veggies (though I often run out mid-week or didn't prep enough), and a starch. Pasta doesn't fill me up, and I rarely eat white breads since I'm hungry an hour later.

Are there other food groups I should be including? Is it normal to feel so hungry after just 3 hours? This economy is rough but ya boy's got to eat.

And what would be some less unhealthy options to buy at the store to keep me full, especially on days I didn't meal prep enough? My usual go to are breaded chicken patties, but I'd like to find other protein and/or fiver rich options.",budgetfood

The pot cost me $4.30 to make and we had enough for 3 hungry toddlers (2 big bowls each) and my husband and I  (2 even bigger bowls each) and we also had enough for one person to have leftovers tomorrow.

RECIPE:
3 cans Pork and Beans in tomato sauce (15oz Walmart/Aldi brand)
1 can tomato sauce (15oz Walmart brand)
1 box Detalini pasta (grocery store brand usually 88¢ on sale--stock up then!)
Olive oil
Minced Garlic
Pepper to taste and more for serving
Salt

DIRECTIONS:
Bring a pot of salted water to boil For the pasta and cook until aldante. While the water is boiling, heat a few teaspoons of olive oil in another pot. Add a teaspoon or two of minced garlic and saute until you can smell it. Pour in the pork and beans and tomato sauce over the garlic and bring to a gentle boil. Add pepper (start with a teaspoon and add more if desired). Reduce heat and let simmer until your pasta is done cooking.
Add pasta to your bowl and top with the beans mixture. Store separately so the pasta and beans mixture don't mix.

Feel free to adjust to your taste. When my husband makes this he adds more tomato sauce but I prefer it a little bit less soupy.

1715850953.0,Cheapest way to get all nutrients for a perfectly healthy life ,"I'm looking for the most economical way to ensure I'm getting all the necessary nutrients for my body, without considering taste or texture. Do you have any recommendations? I've considered meal replacement powders, but they seem too expensive. I've also tried searching for an app that can create a weekly meal plan based on this criteria, but I haven't found any. The apps tend to waste money by purchasing too many ingredients. I've also considered the option of simply getting a combination of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins from the cheapest sources and then supplementing with tablets for the remaining nutrients. Has anyone tried this approach before? Are there perhaps other approaches that I have not yet considered?

Currently, I mostly rely on buying the cheapest vegetables available by the kilo, cooking them with a bit of oil and eggs, and seasoning with a little salt and nothing else. However, I'm concerned that this may not be the healthiest option since I'm eating mostly the same vegetables week after week and may be missing out on some essential nutrients. For example, I often use a combination of frozen spinach, broccoli, legume and eggs and eat them with some pasta.",budgetfood

1715745736.0,Bone-in Skin-on Chicken thighs are great on a budget for more than just meat!,"Making this post because I had a less-than resouceful friend buy herself the boneless, skinless chicken thighs for way more than she should’ve. These tips also work for different cuts of chicken with skin and bones (though with drumsticks I usually just cook them in soup as-is).

Yes, the ones with skin on and bones included are cheaper by weight than the alternative, but if you’ve been just throwing the skin and bones away, stop! I have some budget friendly tips for you. 

1) Collect the skin and bones and put them in separate gallon-sized freezer bags. You will be adding to them as you get more chicken. For the skin, keep adding chicken skins and fat to them. For the bag with the bones, you will also want to add veggie scraps such as the skins of onions, garlic, carrots, ginger, and celery. There are others you can add, but if you aren’t familiar with cooking times and qualities of vegetables yet, I’d try to just stick with those. Again, it’s better to use organic veggies or ones sourced from someone you know uses less pesticides when growing as you’re using the skins for this. 

2) when you have a good amount of skins(like 3/4lbs or more), make shmaltz (rendered chicken fat). It’s basically the Jewish alternative to lard and tallow. It’s healthier than most cooking oils aside from avocado, olive, and coconut. It has a high smoke point so you can use it to fry, roast, bake, or whatever it is you do with your cooking oils. Because it is animal based, the chemical structure is easier to digest. You might want to steer clear if you have heart problems, though. I used a recipe from Serious Eats which goes like this:

- heat up a saucepan with about a cup of water over medium high heat and put in the chicken skins + fat, stirring occasionally until it starts to boil. 

- turn heat down to medium low and continue to stir occasionally until the chicken bits start to turn brown and crispy and the water is evaporated (about 50 minutes). Some people like to add chopped onions around the end for extra flavor. 

- filter with a sieve/muslin cloth over a heatproof container. If left in an airtight container in the fridge, sources say you can store from a week until a few months, depending on how secure and refined your shmaltz is after rendering. If you want, you can also snack on the chicken bits as a crispy snack!

3) When you eventually collect enough bones and scraps to fill the ziplock bag, you can make bone broth (or stock, for the anti-hippies). I sometimes add pork bones if I get any with my meat. I make mine in an instant pot so I’m going to use that recipe. 

- Dump contents of stock bag into instant pot and cover with water (filtered is best). You can also add aromatics like bay leaf and peppercorns in, though some people like to drink it like a tea, so you could omit. 

- Set to high pressure for 1.5 hours. Natural release (just don’t touch it til the pressure indicator falls down). 

- Filter with a sieve to a separate container and not your sink! You can freeze portions for later. Salt to taste. 

Bone broth(stock) is really good for your bones and adds a really nice flavor to whatever you use it for. Consider using it instead of store-bought stock or Better than Bouillon. You can use it for a healthy egg-drop soup. Supposedly some people use it in smoothies, but personally that’s not for me!

I like to get the crunchier packs of chicken when I can afford to (think free-range, organic, locally sourced), and if you have the means to, you should too since you can utilize all parts of the cut.

It was an important group since my son was diagnosed as celiac at a time when gluten-free products were scarce and VERY expensive.  The group disbanded years ago.

When I see bulk products on sale (currently 55 pounds Jasmine rice on sale for $29.99 and 40 pounds of fresh jalapeno peppers for $19.99) I wish I had someone to split the cost and food with.  I skip the deals because I just can't use that much of a single food item, even if I preserve it for long term storage. 

I'd like to start a small local buying group that can take advantage of these deals and split the food/cost.  I do remember the organizer of the group I use to belong to said it was difficult to have a large group because people wouldn't show up to take their stuff, which was a problem if it needed refrigeration or a freezer.

In this article, we invite you to fall in love with food all over again as we explore the versatility of Chicken Al Pastor and guide you through crafting your own version, done your way.

## The Allure of Chicken Al Pastor

### A Culinary Romance

Chicken Al Pastor is a dish that inspires passion and excitement among food lovers worldwide. Originating in Mexico but influenced by Middle Eastern flavors, this dish is a testament to the power of culinary fusion. Its combination of tender chicken, sweet pineapple, and aromatic spices creates a symphony of flavors that dance on the palate with every bite.

With a few simple tweaks and substitutions, you can customize this dish to reflect your own culinary preferences and dietary requirements.

## Crafting Your Perfect Chicken Al Pastor

### Essential Ingredients

Before we delve into the various methods for preparing  [**Sheet pan chicken al pastor recipe**](https://dailynewrecipe.com/easy-sheet-pan-chicken-al-pastor-recipe/) , let's take a look at the essential ingredients you'll need:

* 2 lbs boneless, skinless chicken thighs, thinly sliced
* 1 cup pineapple chunks
* 1 red onion, sliced
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce
* 2 tablespoons adobo sauce
* 2 tablespoons lime juice
* 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
* 1 tablespoon honey
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
* 1 teaspoon dried oregano
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Tortillas, for serving
* Fresh cilantro, chopped, for garnish
* Lime wedges, for serving

### Your Way, Your Method

Now that you have your ingredients assembled, it's time to choose your preferred method of preparation. Here are three popular methods for making Chicken Al Pastor:

#### 1. Sheet Pan Chicken Al Pastor

This method is perfect for busy weeknights when you want a flavorful meal with minimal effort. Simply marinate the chicken, pineapple, and onion in the spicy adobo sauce, then roast everything together on a sheet pan until tender and caramelized.

#### 2. Grilled Chicken Al Pastor

For a smoky flavor and a hint of char, fire up the grill and cook your marinated chicken, pineapple, and onion over medium-high heat until cooked through and slightly charred. Serve the grilled chicken al pastor in warm tortillas for a delicious summer meal.

#### 3. Slow Cooker Chicken Al Pastor

If you prefer a hands-off approach, let your slow cooker do the work for you. Simply add the marinated chicken, pineapple, and onion to the slow cooker and cook on low for 6-8 hours or on high for 3-4 hours until the chicken is tender and the flavors have melded together beautifully.

## Conclusion: Embrace the Flavorful Journey

In conclusion, Chicken Al Pastor is a dish that's as versatile as it is delicious. Whether you choose to make it on a sheet pan, grill it to perfection, or let it simmer away in the slow cooker, the end result is sure to be a mouthwatering masterpiece.

here are some ideas for meals which me and my family prepared last week. As the prices in the country where we live in have significantly increased we are trying to come up with some budget friendly but still relatively healthy meals.

1) Chicken thighs with potatoes and onions - season the chicken with spices of choice, prepare some olive oil, lemon juice, garlic chopped into small pieces and salt and combine everything. Bake until golden brown. 

2) Spinach soup with rice - chop carrots and onions and fry them in a little bit of oil until soft (around 10 minutes), add the spinach (I used frozen) and cook for 5 more minutes, add some water and the rice and cook until the rice is ready, in the end add some beaten egg yolks with yogurt for a silky soup.

3) Zuchinni gratin - zucchini, eggs, feta cheese, some fresh parsley and melty cheese for the top

4) Chicken salad - grilled chicken, iceberg, tomatoes, cucumbers, olives and dressing - some greek yoghurt, mustard, lemon juice, salt and pepper.

Hope I have given you some inspiration for your next meal plan. The recipes in many different variations can be found in the web.

So Saturday is my ""eat it up"" day and I try o be creative with the repurposing so the day's meals don't feel stale.

Today I have/had:

Half a can's worth of diced tomatoes

About 1l4 cup mushrooms

Left over roasted beets

1 oven fried chicken quarter

Goat cheese ( given to me)

Celery stalks

Apples are still good, and I always keep a cheddar or some store brand block cheese on hand. I also found some provolone slices in my cheese drawer, so that's got to get eaten


I keep a pretty well stocked pantry so herbs, olive oil etc are pretty much on hand and I always have one type of flat bread or bread, Greek yougurt,  eggs in the house too.

Brunch was a shaushka for one made with the left over diced tomato with toast.

I'm skipping lunch as I really only eat two meals because I'm just not hungry  for three these days. If I am hungry for a snack I'll probably do an apple, peanut butter  and crackers.

Tonight I m either going to do a beet chicken goat cheese panni. But then I'm thinking you know what? I'm going to do a hmm Eastern European inspired quesadilla night. I'm going do a beet,  chicken goat cheese quesadilla.  Then, since I got the wrong grocery order delivered( free goat cheese and like 2 lbs of celery!) I'm thinking I'm going to try to make a let's say Eastern European inspired celery salsa. My plan is to finely minced celery and onion with some thick plain Greek yogurt ( I use yougurt instead of sour cream) lemon and dill. 
Make a stock with the left over chicken bones from my leg quarter.

Buy your favorite roast and cut your roast into steaks, and according to the thickness you like. You can also ask the store's butcher to cut it for you, free of charge. Steaks that won't be cooked, properly store them in your freezer, and make sure you label it with a date. Cook your steaks with your favorite sides.

1711046744.0,Fruit Chutney Mayo Chicken,"This is a really delicious alternative for meals, if you're like me who is tired of chicken spice, hell i've tried even mince spice on chicken & frankly no money for spices or marinades. Try this. So all it needs is 3 table spoon Mayo, i used lite/reduced oil due to being on a caloric deficit and 2-3 table spoon chutney and as the chicken is frying

You coat it and let it simmer into a sauce.

Sure its not as healthy if you're trying to lose body fat but it makes up for it, standard mayo puts the sauce mixture around 300 calories with the lite version making it around 100-150 calories if i recall correctly, might be lower, mine showed the mayo was around 85-87cal.

You pair it with rice though i didn't due to going low carb, so only steamed veg in my lunches.

Doing a degree in my 30s, finding ways to eat on the cheap

£1.25 is about my average dinner budget atm, but you could cut the chicken and cheese and get it down to something like 50p a meal, and it'd still be banging

Makes \~8 good sized meals, takes about 45 mins

&#x200B;

**Ingredients:**

900g Chicken Thighs (£5 in the Lidl by me)

2 fat Courgettes

1 Red Onion (on the bigger end, if you got small boys in that 95p tesco thing go for 2)

4-5 cloves of Garlic - could happily use garlic powder if that's what you got

100g Pesto, half a jar

125g cheddar (or whatever cheese)

75g plain white flour

75g butter

1 Pint Milk (I used oat)

\~750g Chunky Pasta

&#x200B;

**Roast your veg and meat:**

Dice the chicken and courgette \~1"" chunks, pop in a mixing bowl

Finely dice the onion and mince the garlic, add em in

Season with salt and pepper and toss in a tablespoon of oil - this is the only seasoning you'll add, except the salt in the pasta water, so don't skip it!

Spread everything out on a tray - it'll be cramped but it's fine

Roast for 40-45 mins @ 175C fan or 190C w/o (340 or 375F), turn half-way through

&#x200B;

Chillout for maybe 15 mins

&#x200B;

**Pasta**

Start boiling the pasta water around when you flip the veg - Pasta goes in as soon as it starts boiling, follow the instructions for whatever pasta you've got. This is gonna sit in your fridge in the sauce for several days so keep an eye and don't let it overcook!

&#x200B;

**Sauce:**

Make a [basic white sauce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCHKFwTYwjY) \- I'm not going to go through this step here, it's not too hard to do but it's a bugger to explain in text, much easier to just watch Kenji smash it

Once the sauce has thickened, heat all the way down, crumble the cheese in and continue to whisk consistently while it melts

Once the cheese is melted make sure the heat is off, and whisk in that pesto

&#x200B;

**Put it all together:**

Dump the roasted bits on top of the drained pasta, and stir it all in - don't be afraid to skim some of the chicken fat and garlicy veg juices from the roasting tray when you do this, it'll add some flavour but don't bosh it all in in case the sauce separates too much

Pour the cheesey green bechamel straight into the pot and stir that bad boy up

I scraped the rim of my pesto out to get that little dollop on top, but it's not necessary

Taste is a 10/10, not too much faff, plenty calories, plenty nutrients, good bit of protein

So I live in a small town that's homeless population has exploded since the cost of living in BC went psychotic. And while small compared to other towns, our town is severely lacking in support for them everything there is is 100 percent volunteer. the soup kitchen is only once a week, and the food bank is used by alot of ppl and families and is already super strained. A local church has set up an emergency homeless shelter that's shutting down... and has some food,

The only other option during winter was a sobering centre Wich required ppl to intoxicated to seek shelter there.. I know at least one man who would drunk specifically to be able to get in when the shelter was full..

I was planning on working with the church I used to volunteer with or setting up smth that would provide meals and even serve hot ones on a semi regular basis. But im not exactly rolling in cash myself and groceries in my town are 25 to 40 percent more expensive than  alot of BC to begin with... Yay rural towns...  once I get my passport back, my budget will open up significantly but until then I'm trying to keep it as cheap as possible while still being filling and not gross

I'm thinking a mix off bagged lunches or dinners that don't require refrigeration or heating up and  another hot meal once or twice a week. 

(Hopefully more often in the future but I'm not gonna ask for donations til I can get smth going, and have a solid base of proof the money would go towards food (don't have support of a church or volunteer group yet.)

For hot meals things easy to make in bulk, like a filling soup and buns or eggs and pancakes. (Can get eggs decently cheap again here thank god.)

I search a easy recipe to do a Chana Masala.   


That was the steps i found and follow:  


Ingredientes:

\- Chickpeas (in this case I used 800g)

\- 400g Tomato Pulp/Tomato pieces

\- 1 Onion

\- 4 cloves of garlic or 1 Tablespoon of Garlic Pasta

\- 1 Tablespoon of Ginger Powder

\- 1 Tablespoon of Garam Masala (1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon powder, 1/4 teaspoon of coriander, 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg, 1/4 teaspoon of ground cloves)

\- 1 Cayena Pepper Teasoon

\- 1 Lemon

\- Parsley

\- Sal Q.B.

\- Water or water from cooking chickpeas.

\- 2 Tablespoons of Olive Oil

&#x200B;

Instructions:

1 - If you have chosen dry chickpeas, soak them for at least 12 hours.

2 - Cook the chickpeas and reserve the cooking water for later in the recipe.

3 - In a large pan, heat the Olive Oil over medium heat, add the onion with the garlic, salt and let it sauté.

4 - Add the spices (Ginger, Garam Masala, Curry/Saffron and Cayenne Pepper). Keep stirring and smell the spices.

5 - Add the tomato sauce and the same amount of tomato, add water (better if it is cooking water) and mix well.

6 - Remove 100g of chickpeas from the 800g and grind. Add the crushed grain to the pan.

7 - Finally add the chickpeas. Let cook for at least 10 minutes so the flavors can develop.

8 -Finish with a touch of finely chopped parsley, lemon juice (and pulp if you like)

1709752043.0,ADVICE: How to spice up a simple tuna rice bowl," 

Hello! The title pretty much says it all. One of my favourite simple work meals is literally just:

\- A pre-cooked microwave container of white rice  
(I buy them in big boxes at HMart/Han Ah Reum/Asian market), and

\- A flavoured pack of tuna  
(right now it's Target's Good and Gather Sweet and Spicy pack)

While this is cheap, gets me through the day, and does the job, I'm looking for things that can be added to make it more nutritious or exciting, like an added vegetable or seasoning. The only requirements (aside from being delicious and going with the only two ingredients) is that it has to be shelf-stable and single-serving, so I can grab one of whatever it is and throw it into the container with the rice and tuna.

1709692855.0,Suggestions for a Picky Eater,"Hello! Picky eater here.

I've begun a journey on eating less food & eating better overall in the last 5 months. With how expensive food has gotten 
 & such, I'm also using this journey as an opportunity to cut out some excessive food spending habits on fast food and the like. So I'd love some input from you all!

I am extremely picky, it's mostly a texture thing I think... combined with the fact that my siblings and I were mostly fending for ourselves when it comes to food from a very young age. Happens when you have 2nd/3rd shift working parents. So most of my usual meals are things a 5-10 year old could make themselves (I am almost 30). I am not overly willing to expand my food horizon; and over the years I have actually become MORE picky! There were foods I used to eat when I was younger (baby corn, shrimp, sirloin steak) that I no longer eat. I currently take an adult gummy multivitamin to help with the lack of actual nutrients I get due to what I do actually eat.

Here is my general list of what I do eat:

Vegetables: broccoli, lettuce, carrot

Fruits: raspberry, apple, pear, banana

Meat/Protein: chicken (must not be on-the-bone), steak (only in mexican dishes), ham, turkey, hamburgers, hot-dogs, sausage/pepperoni (only on pizza), peanuts, black beans, pinto beans

[notable things missing here: I won't eat bone-in chicken, bacon, non-mexican dish steak, sausage (not on pizza), ground beef, eggs]

Grains/Breads: most breads, pasta, pretzel, bagel, tortilla, english muffin, granola, popcorn, pizza, most cereals

[notable things missing here: I won't eat rice, quinoa, corn, oatmeal]

Dairy: most standard cheeses, skim milk, cheese curds, yogurt (not greek), cream cheese

[notable things missing here: I won't eat cottage cheese, I don't enjoy eating butter on things (it's fine baked in), sour cream]

Can clarify on other things that I forgot here (obviously a lot), but for the most part if it's not listed on here I probably won't eat it (although I may have missed some things). As you can see, most of the things I eat coincide quite well with fast food... which definitely adds up cost-wise. So I'd really like to get some suggestions to broaden my meals!

Any tips or good cheap meal ideas would be much appreciated!! :)",budgetfood

1709131208.0,How to prep shredded chicken,"I know some of you have wanted some shredded chicken for a recipe and have to cook it up then shred it before you start the recipe. Or perhaps you needed chicken broth for a recipe.

Here is what I do. I hit Walmart or Aldi's or any other supermarket that has those 5 or 10# bags of chicken charters. Grab one.

At home I prep a roasting pan but you could use a couple of casserole dishes.

I mix up some rub for the chicken. 1tlbs onion powder 1 tbsp garlic powder 1/tbsp thyme 1 tbsp salt 1.5 tsp of pepper.
I use the above as a rub for the chicken.
First wash the thighs well using your fingertip to press our the coagulated  blood at the boney edge of the leg quarter washing them all off.
I then cut off fatty pieces and set them aside 
Now place in roasting pan sprinkle rub mix on chicken. If using a full roaster with a lid I will double stack theeg quarters in it seasoning each layer.
Once done place the fat rimming around edge of chicken preferably near the bottom.
Cover roasting pan with lid or tin foil and place in an oven preheated to 425 degrees for 80 minutes if using double stacked roasting pan or as little as 1 hour in a large casserole dish.

When done remove from oven.
I use a cookie sheet as a work surface for deboning the chicken on.
I carefully remove all the meat breaking it into edible shreds for recipes at the same time putting all the .eat in one bowl. I will put the bones aside.
When liquid in pan has cooled to warm I will transfer it to either 1 cup or 2 cup containers with tight fitting lids for freezing for use later in dishes.

If cooking for 2 I will divide the chicken into 1.25 cup amounts. And place in freezer bags removing as much air as possible. And then freeze for use later.
This will give you between 4-6# out of 10lb bag.
If you want you can use the bones and boil them cooking them to help make a mild broth for use. Not very economical due to cost of electricity unless you do it by the large stockpot full.

The broth you have frozen will freeze in3 layers top most fatty rich on top which is great in almost any casserole or pot pie recipe, 2nd layer is the very rich gelatinous layer. This has some of the richest most nutrient broth which you could think down to half by adding water and reheating. The third layer is the bits of flavor from the broth that settled usually only about a tablespoons worth.
Now you can save the broth into smaller amounts but do so before it starts to lose its warmth.

By doing this you get great chicken and a broth you can not find in stores that will boost the flavor of any casserole calling for chicken broth.",budgetfood

1708926614.0,I got an insane deal on chicken drumsticks. What are some different sides you like serving with them?,"Hi everyone! I got 4.6 pounds of chicken drumsticks for $5.60. I’ve never gotten chicken drumsticks before because my grocery nearby only has them in quantities of 14 and I have limited fridge space sharing a fridge in a college apartment. However, this deal was so good I had to try meal prepping some! I oven roasted them at 425 for 45 minutes, seasoning some with lemon pepper and most of them with my usual favorite chicken seasoning (goes w Mexican dishes and Italian dishes really well). I’m going to be eating these for dinners and lunches. Any ideas of good sides to make with them or different ways to prepare the drumsticks so I don’t get repetitive?

1708888395.0,"Low food budget with 3 allergies, is it possible?!","I have never really budgeted before (just didn't buy groceries when we didn't have the money) but now need a kind of extreme one to bulk up our drained savings; like maybe $350 a month. I crunched some numbers and found our average food budget for the month is $775 for my family of 4.5 (2 kids under 4, I'm due in July). We live in a pretty rural area and COL is pretty low but the only stores less than 10 min drive are Sav A Lot and Kroger. There is an Aldi about 25 miles away, and a Wal Mart (but I honestly hate Walmart and want to avoid it if I can). We have gluten intolerance, peanut and egg allergies in the house so that like 3 of the main cheap foods we can't have. Also dealing with some pre-diabetes so white rice and potatoes just got cut (and can't eat brown rice or quinoa because of other digestive issues). I have tried Budget Bytes in the past, and also Shelf Cooking but half of the time I have to use rice or sub in gf noodles. Also most cheap recipes are like ""hey, throw an egg on some rice"" but then I'm the only one in the house who can eat it. My kids eat a lot of fruits and veggies and hate chicken nuggets and macaroni and cheese so I don't get lots of prepackaged food either. I basically make what I can from scratch (and egg free + gluten free baking is the literal worst thing to attempt). Idk this feels really impossible. I don't know if anyone else out there has to deal with this, but if you do, please tell me your secrets. Is it possible to do a weekly food budget of <$100 with food allergies?!",budgetfood

While I'm coping, my mom is not. My father was terminal. I've been living and caring for them for several years now and my budget is extremely limited now. Lucky for me, it always wasn't that way. So I have a lot of RANDOM stuff. 

In all of this, I work full time and my mother hasn't been eating. I don't need healthy stuff. Not right now. If it happens to be healthy, bonus points. I just need my mom to actually eat (shes on meds, talks to someone, ect, but its only doing so much).

I need ideas that she can just pull out of the fridge. It doesn't even have to be a full meal (She'd rather graze all day then eat a full meal). She doesn't put effort into actually heating it up if i'm not home (which is like half the week). She was eating cold sandwiches and thats about it (ham, cheese, mayo, bread).

I cannot have a lot of fiber in my diet, as well as lactose (I can tolerate a small amount). I cannot tolerate corn products either, as well as corn syrup. I’m also allergic to shellfish and mushrooms. I cannot have almonds or peanuts, but all other nuts and seeds are OK.   Misc other things but they are easy to avoid or workaround. I CAN have all citrus, hard cheeses, rice, pasta, plain carbs like bagels and bread,  any poultry or red meat (am also a big fan of pork),  some vegetables as long as they are low fiber. 


I’m trying to find high protein meals that are also budget friendly and nutritious for lunch and/or dinner. With all of my restrictions, it’s hard and sometimes makes me overspend.  

Also if anyone can help me to wrap my mind around adding veggies to homemade pasta (like it’s in the noodle???) I would really like to know how to do that cheaply. 

Any help and suggestions are very greatly appreciated!

1708303157.0,Chicken stock ingredients/ recipe and a few things,"It's my 21st (as of 2 days) so give me a break on the sodas, they're for mixed drinks. Def nonessential but still under $8 for something that will last me probably over a week. I got some milk and chicken specifically for protein. The chicken was on manager's special and was $3.08. I couldn't NOT get it. I can't buy mass produced stocks due to being allergic to carrot and celery, so I have to make my own from scratch, and I want to see what the financial impact is. It's gonna cost;

3.08 for whole chicken
8.60 for leq quarters 4.30 1/2 package
.08 for lemongrass
.79 for garlic
1.06 for onion
2.69 for herbs

Plus some whole peppercorn and clove I have here at home, which are $1.99 e per package. (El guapo brand). 

For the ingredients as bought (not including salt) it would be a bit over $20 with tax. From a restaurant style economy standpoint (which is how I try to budget as most of my food waste is upcycled and I'm not just buying ingredients for recipes besides in instances like this,) most of the chicken meat is going to get turned into shredded chicken, so we can say that the $7.38 on chicken is actually closer to a few dollars (gonna make it a clean $2.50 for ease, $1.50 for the chicken carcass and $1 for the bones out of the legs) at most on the scraps. I'm not using all my peppercorns and cloves (6~ pieces e), so we can cut that down to a quarter each. Factor in a quarter for the oil I'll be using while roasting. Before I do the math here, I want to say that the great thing about stocks and broths is that the yield can kind of be stretched by further reductions. Obviously I'm not going for an ultra gelatinous or dark stock, but it's possible for me to stop as soon as I have a coherent stock OR I can keep going and reducing until I don't have enough freezer storage for it all. So I'm gonna say that I'll be getting about 2.5 qts or 80 oz, since the bones and veg are gonna take up some volume in my stock pot.

$2.50 for roasted chicken bones
$4.70 for other bought ingredients (rounded to nearest tenth for each item)

50¢ for pepper and cloves, up to $1 for optional spices and salt

30¢ for oil (rounding again for ease and to compensate for error, honestly oil is so cheap it's only this much as I use highish end olive oil when I can get it on sale.)

So we're spending definitely under $10, maybe like $9.50 on 80+ oz of chicken bone broth. Kettle and fire is $4.50 right now for a quart sized container, $5.60 reg. So for $9.50 plus time and electricity we are getting the equivalent of spending $15-20 with tax on broth at the store. A basic chicken stock recipe can be broken up over multiple days (prep/ roasting and then stock making, which itself could take 2 days if you can't leave your stock simmering while you are working or sleeping for instance)",budgetfood

1708300306.0,Budget Chicken Leg Quarter Meal Prep,"Picked up this big bag of chicken leg orders for $5.90 at the local Food Lion. It’s usually $8-9 dollars but regularly goes on sale for $5-6. 

It’s a good amount of meat for a small amount of money. Because it’s bone in the drippings are also something you can do a lot with in terms of seasoning veggies, sauces, rice or using it for soups. You’ll get an average of 10 pieces in the bag. This bag will do 4-5 main entree of meals for two of us, with a bit of leeway for a smaller piece or us splitting a second piece. 

You can do anything with these. Whatever sauce you have is usually great. I use everything from BBQ sauce, Italian dressing, powdered ranch, to simple olive oil with lemon juice and garlic. 
One of the things I’m using some old olive tamponade I found in the back of the fridge with a couple of olives. If I’m feeling lazy, I’ll just rub them down with olive oil, salt and pepper and season them later after planning out the rest of the meal. 

One batch is the olive tapenade, a few black olives at the bottom of the jar, and the rest of a can of dice tomatoes I used for something else. The others are a powdered tikka seasoning, a salsa cream with some limes (rapidly approaching their sell by), and a simple creole seasoning. First rub them down with olive oil and salt/pepper. Season as you wish and then add in a smattering of various onion, celery, peppers. Veggies are more for flavor since I will make other side dishes to go with the chicken. 

Bake at 350 until internal temp reaches 165. Spoon some of the drippings on top when it’s done. Voila. I will serve these with a mix of variously seasoned rice, beans, sweet potatoes, and veggies. May pull it off the bone to go in a salad or pasta.",budgetfood

I’m moving in with my boyfriend tomorrow!!! I’m super excited!! We’re starting to discuss our budget (rent and utilities are already decided obviously), but as far as groceries and eating out go- we’re kinda confused.

I’ve been buying my own groceries for around a year and I spent anywhere from $60-$120 / month on groceries. (I don’t eat a lot and when I do, I cook. I also have a lot in the house like a lot of pasta and marinara & a pound of that will last me 3 meals, so super simple stuff. I also usually only eat breakfast on weekends & buy a lot of frozen food from Trader Joe’s and just stock up and eat it for a while. Lots of girl dinners around here too). 

However, my bf eats a lot. He’s a man in his 20s and he exercises so it’s expected, but idk how to account for it. I know the pound of pasta that lasts me 3 meals lasts the 2 of us together one meal & he needs protein with it. 

- Is $250/month realistic for the two of us on groceries? (With $100 combined for eating out on top of that)

- What foods are beneficial to buy in bulk to save money? We have a Sam’s club card & Amazon prime accounts. 

- What foods are cheaper to make yourself rather than buy? I have a bread machine and have been thinking of making bread at home as well as maybe even bagels to help save. I also make marinara myself. But what else? 

- Any other general food money saving tips are appreciated!!

I need a certain amount of calories/protein a day to maintain weight. I was recently put into a situation that will prevent me from having access to a refrigerator/freezer of any kind until about June which means 3 enormously essential food items I was relying on will not be an option.... unless of course a workaround can be found OR other food items of a similar calorie/protein rating that don't require refrigeration can substitute them.

I was purchasing 5 dozen eggs every month for $20 which is very good. Bread was $1.99 a loaf and I would use 6 p/mo. Balogna was really cheap as well. I'm incredibly stressed and don't know what to do. It really doesn't get cheaper than that. I can't store any food at any families home either.

The bright side is nearly everything in my list requires ZERO refrigeration. It's just those three very essential items that I cannot wrap my head around. If you notice, ""Lunch"" in the list is the only ""real"" meal in the entire list as well. Breakfast and 2 protein shakes aren't really ""whole foods/protein sources"" so I'm freaking out.

1707667857.0,Thoughts on sardines - anyone here feel that it's a budget food?,"Interested in people's thoughts on this.  I've seen sardines have a wide range in prices at the local grocery stores.  I've seen them as cheap as $1.10 per can (Chicken of the Sea, oil packed) to over $3.00 per can (King Oscar).  For adults 1 can is 1 serving - though the calories will be somewhere between 200 to 250 calories.  I've tried some of the King Oscar brand and it's quite approachable plain out of the can with olive oil (from the can).  I've not tried any other brand yet but I do have some sardines from Season - cheaper than King Oscar but not ""Chicken of the Sea"" pricing either.  

I think this can fall into the realm of a budget food IF we take into account the health benefits.  Good source of protein, high in Omega 3 fatty acids, great sources of Vitamin D and Calcium.  

For those who enjoy eating sardines - do you have any brand recommendations that are affordable that you like?  Can anyone tell me if the Chicken of the Sea brand is a solid choice for sardines despite being cheaper than the rest I typically see?  I'm going to be eating them at least 2 times per week for health reasons, but if I can zero in on an affordable brand that still tastes good then I'm all in.",budgetfood

1707630523.0,Freezing Hacks for Proteins,"Some may know these, but for those may not, there are a few hacks for freezing proteins to be more  cost-effective and save money on your grocery bill. 

1) Buy ground beef, chicken breasts or thighs, pork chops, smoked sausage in bulk. Wholesale clubs offer better prices per pound than the grocery stores.

2) Break down these large packages into smaller portions (per meal, per week, whatever works for you). Put the selected amount into a ziploc freezer bag, label it along with date and description. Put these smaller bags into a larger ziploc freezer bag. Place it in the freezer. Take out only the packs you need for that meal or menu and thaw. 

3) If buying ground beef in one-pound vacuum packed packages, put them into a freezer bag to freeze. Do not just store them in the vacuum pack only. These could have tiny pin holes that let in air while frozen (gets freezer burn), or worse, will leak out fluid when thawed, making a mess. Put the individual freezer portions into a larger freezer bag. Take out only what is needed. 

4) If buying large bags of IQF chicken thighs, breasts, or pork chops, put these IQF bags into larger freezer bags to provide a barrier to freezer burn and prolong the freshness of the IQF proteins purchased.

5) Make sure to label and date the items, and rotate the bags as you replenish the various meats. 

This will make things easier for cooking and prepping.",budgetfood

1707590759.0,"Subway Hack for California Residents & Costco Members - $3 6"" subs","Hi. Please don't downvote for the complexity of the hack, we just enjoy combining deals.

Costco is running a gift card deal on Subway, 5 cards with $15 face value for $55.

You cash price is $11 per card or 27% off.

For residents of California, by law any gift card under $10 can be redeemed for cash. It's the law!

A classic 6 inch sub is about $6.75-$7 including tax (will vary by county).

&#x200B;

$15 GC minus $7 sub = $8 remaining cash(ask cashier for cash back)

$11 gift card minus $8 redemption = $3 sub!

I know a bit complicated, but if you live in CA, go to Costco (you can purchase online), and Subway is in your lunch rotation, why not give this a shot. Its over 50% off!!

While this will work on foot long as well, the sweet spot is items between $5 and $7 in order to maximize cash back. Breakfast options are great too as they are a bit cheaper.

1707340667.0,Some cheapo tips,"Hello everyone. This is my first time posting. I wanted to share with y'all some of the ways that I like to be cheap and make meal prep easier. 

1. put left over bits of potatoes, rice, pasta, vegetables and meat in a Ziploc gallon size, freezer bag and freeze. Don't take it off of someone's plate. I'm talking about what is left in the pan/pot. Once the bag is full, make soup. 
2. Buy your meat in bulk. Sometimes you can find killer deals. When you get home, go ahead and separate it into meal size portions, then freeze. For something like ground beef, you can brown, drain and put into quart size freezer bags and freeze. This can make meal prep a smidgeon faster. 
3. Jars of pasta sauce can be used for a tomato base for soup or chili. Heat it up as is and use it in place of tomato soup.  It's delicious to dip your grilled cheese in. You can also spice it up and make it into sloppy joes.
4. Dry crusty breads like Italian or French, make great croutons, French toast or as a fantastic base for SOS aka beef and gravy. My granny used to take thick slices of it, pour a little boiling water on it, let it sit for a minute; then add salt and pepper. She would also pour cold milk and a spoonful of sugar on it. It was super simple, but dang it was good. 
5. Boxes stuffing mix is one of the best things that you can have in your pantry. It can be mixed with ground beef/pork to make a meat loaf, add 2 cups of water or broth to the dry mix and stir. This can then be placed on top of pot pie or even shepherds pie. Plus it smells like heaven.
6.Last but not least, preparing meals for your family and friends doesn't have to be a huge production. Granted there are allergies and picky eaters to deal with; but keeping it simple is just as good as a full spread. Make a big pot of spaghetti, a simple green salad and come up with a dessert from what you already have at home and you fill people's bellies and warm their spirits. 

I have a lot of other ideas, if y'all are curious. Heck ask a question or twelve and I bet that I can offer some input.

And here’s the recipe again, if anyone missed it. Can be made hot with mushroom gravy or slice it cold for sandwiches. 

1 cup of cooked lentils (see below)
2 eggs 
1 small onion, diced 
1 carrot, shredded 
1 cup of chopped mushrooms (can also use canned, drained, and chopped) 
(An additional cup of mushrooms, if you want to make mushroom gravy. Make your own or use a packet.)
2 tbsps olive oil for sautéing the onions and veggies 
1/2-1 cup of oat flour ( l grind my own from rolled oats using a food processor)
3/4 cup of whole rolled oats 
Spices: 
1 tbsp onion powder 
1 tbsp garlic powder 
1 1/2 tsp Garam Masala ( if you don’t have, you can use a 1/2 tsp each of cumin, sage and paprika) 
1/4 tsp salt 
1/4 tsp black pepper 

You can use canned or dried lentils. I prefer using dried. (use brown or green because they will retain their shape better and not be too mushy) 
l prepared mine by first rinsing and inspecting the dry lentils for debris. Add them to a pot with 4 cups of water. I add beef or vegetable bullion for flavor. Refer to the instructions on your package for how much to add per cup of water. Bring the pot to a rapid boil, then lower down to the lowest setting and cover. Simmer on low for about 20-30 minutes . So at around the 20 minutes, start checking them to see if they are tender. You want them tender, but not mushy. Drain into a large bowl and put them in the fridge to cool a bit. (If using canned lentils, drain them well.)

Preheat your oven to 375 degrees.  Line a loaf pan with parchment or grease the pan. Sauté your onion, and mushrooms (if using fresh). 

Take out your lentils and mash, keeping some whole for adding texture to the loaf. You can use a potato masher, or your hands.  Mix into your lentils the oats, veggies, spices and eggs. Add the oat flour starting with 1/2 cup. Combine well and form a loaf. Add additional oat flour as needed. The loaf will be sticky. Add it to your loaf pan. Bake for 45 minutes to an hour. Should be firm to the touch when done. Let cool before slicing and serve with mushroom gravy. Or store in the fridge to slice for sandwiches.",budgetfood

 Can be made hot with mushroom gravy or slice it cold for sandwiches. 

1 cup of cooked lentils (see below)

2 eggs 

1 small onion, diced 

1 carrot, shredded 

1 cup of chopped mushrooms (can also use canned, drained, and chopped) 

(An additional cup of mushrooms, if you want to make mushroom gravy. Make your own or use a packet.)

2 tbsps olive oil for sautéing the onions and veggies 

1/2-1 cup of oat flour ( l grind my own from rolled oats using a food processor)

3/4 cup of whole rolled oats 

Spices: 

1 tbsp onion powder

1 tbsp garlic powder 

1 1/2 tsp Garam Masala ( if you don’t have, you can use a 1/2 tsp each of cumin, sage and paprika) 

1/4 tsp salt 

1/4 tsp black pepper 

You can use canned or dried lentils. I prefer using dried. (use brown or green because they will retain their shape better and not be too mushy) 
l prepared mine by first rinsing and inspecting the dry lentils for debris. Add them to a pot with 4 cups of water. I add beef or vegetable bullion for flavor. Refer to the instructions on your package for how much to add per cup of water. Bring the pot to a rapid boil, then lower down to the lowest setting and cover. Simmer on low for about 20-30 minutes . So at around the 20 minutes, start checking them to see if they are tender. You want them tender, but not mushy. Drain into a large bowl and put them in the fridge to cool a bit. (If using canned lentils, drain them well.)

Preheat your oven to 375 degrees.  Line a loaf pan with parchment or grease the pan. Sauté your onion, and mushrooms (if using fresh). 

Take out your lentils and mash, keeping some whole for adding texture to the loaf. You can use a potato masher, or your hands.  Mix into your lentils the oats, veggies, spices and eggs. Add the oat flour starting with 1/2 cup. Combine well and form a loaf. Add additional oat flour as needed. The loaf will be sticky. Add it to your loaf pan. Bake for 45 minutes to an hour. Should be firm to the touch when done. Let cool before slicing and serve with mushroom gravy. Or store in the fridge to slice for sandwiches.",budgetfood

1706300944.0,$53 Food Budget,"Hey everyone, i need some advice, I'm trying to follow a budget a bit more and just need advice. My budget is $53, note this is for proteins, the carbs and fats i can take from what my family buys.

Any meats you can recommend? Currently i was thinking of buying 7kg of chicken breast for a total of $24-25, they're roughly $3.46 per bag of 5 150g pieces.

I was thinking of getting a tub of Nutritech Heavy Duty Whey, it has 56 servings @ $0.53 per serving so that should last about a month and a half if i don't use a lot though i generally use it for meal replacements at work or if i'm off, as a pre workout meal with coffee.

Another option is maybe a kg of lean mince, the cheapest i found was $4.21 per kg. but that would go above the budget though i can always get more meat if i don't buy the whey, i think i still have about 15 odd servings in my cheaper one i bought last month.

If i don't, i could put that money into more meat, brown rice and possibly veg for a few low carb meals.

I generally take foods from what my family buys, the protein shake is mainly just a meal replacement though the new one i'm considering has creatine mixed in.

Any advice would be appreciated. i Know $53 for a month isn't a lot but its best i can manage while i pay off debt, once that's done, it will probably be $100.

For reference my meals is geared towards helping me cut down on body fat, i'm currently 33.2% and trying to drop down to 15%-20% so my meals tend to be low caloric

Edit:

The only other option i can think of is maybe lower the Whey size down to 900g that's cheaper at 30 servings rather than the more expensive bigger tub. or not buy the Whey at all",budgetfood

1 - 15 oz. can black beans  


1 small onion, pureed

2 tablespoons garlic, minced

1/4 cup \[or 1 packet\] taco seasoning

1 - 8 oz. block extra sharp cheddar cheese, shredded

1 - 10 count box Doritos chips, 1 ounce bags

sour cream, if desired

salsa, if desired

Saute hamburger until most of the way cooked through. Add garlic and pureed onion. Continue sauteing on medium. Add taco seasoning and water as needed. When you're done, turn to low.

Now, prepare the other toppings: Heat beans and prep the way you'd prefer. We use a sprinkle of garlic powder and a sprinkle of onion powder. Finely slice lettuce and grate cheese.

Slice bags of chips open along the side - from top to bottom - this gives a little more eating room.

Add meat and beans to the bag, shaking a little in between. Top with lettuce, cheese, and if desired sour cream and/or salsa.

1705605414.0,Roasted vegetables and fish.,"We are trying to dramatically increase our vegetable intake.  All of this for $54.83.  We should get 5 meals for two adults easily.  That would be $5.48 per serving.  If you remove the fish, it would come to $36.34 for all the veggies.  Or $3.63 per serving.  All of this good will be baked and heavily seasoned with garlic (❤️) and pepper.  I have some lemon pepper for the fish.",budgetfood
1705604154.0,What is cheaper to make at home?,"Obviously just about anything is cheaper to make at home. I am specifically looking for things that are used often that are cheaper to make. 

So for example; bread. Is it actually cheaper to make at home? Walmart has loaves of white bread for $1.32. We got through probably a loaf every other day (I have kids with super high metabolisms and bread is one of their favorite go-to things). 

Broth is another one. 

I guess what I'm looking for is some information on whether certain foods are cheap enough to make at home to be worth all the time and effort you have to put into it. 

I'm a mom of 4 that works full time so I have to factor the amount of time put into things as well. ",budgetfood

A thing of berries is $5.  Cereal is crazy.  What are y’all eating nowadays?  Trying to eat healthy, cheap, and vegetarian.  I gave up meat a while ago to save money and other reasons.

1705511447.0,"As little waste and cost as possible high protein diet, looking for ideas","Hello, i just found this sub so if what im asking for has a good previous post that i didnt find please redirect me!

I eat nearly all my food at work so i mealprep on sunday for mo-weds and wed for thu-fri, in weekends theres no real structure. This is for Belgium/western europe. I've worked as a cook and love asian style food, curries and the lot would be great if theyre not too pungent for the work microwave!

Most of the times my meals are 1 tub of storebrand skyr at €1.40, 1 pack of rice wafers as snack for like 50cents, free soup at work, 2 hot meals of 200gr carbs 200gr protein 100gr veggies. Fruit or other snacks added from time to time.

For my veggies i get mainly frozen veggies or 'weird batch' mushrooms that are discounted because they look strange. For my meat i mainly order this from a fitness website. [musclemeat.nl](https://musclemeat.nl) They sell 2.5kg bags of chicken filet pieces pre-cooked and 10 flavors in the freezer, it ends up at like 12€/kg which is quite a fair price. Most of their other stuff is either dry (because low fat content is their goal) or more expensive (steak etc) so i usually get a few flavors of chicken bits.

I'd like to change this up a bit partially for cost, partially for change and partially because more fiber or less meat isnt necessarily a bad thing i suppose. Veggie sources of protein like beans or lentils would be great, preferably if theyre either quick to make or easy to make in big batches (i got a huge pot that holds chili made with like 3 or 4kg of meat). For onions i've changed to frozen minced onions, its like 8€ for a 2.5kg bag and it feels a lot cheaper since theres so much waste to onions + i got lazy and its so handy.

I've restarted going to the gym again 4-5 times a week training strongman and will start running again once it stops freezing in a week or 2 so i mainly want enough protein intake and carbs are great since theyre cheap and help a lot with how i feel. If protein content is a bit lower i dont mind eating a tin of tuna as snack a day, i quite like the taste and its still affordable.

If its something that i can prep on sunday and is almost guaranteed to be good on friday if refrigerated that'd be amazing.

&#x200B;

TLDR want protein, cheap and quick to prepare, vegetarian is a plus and a few dish rec's would be nice!",budgetfood

1705484611.0,Great Value Instant Mashed Potatoes Weird flavor,"Okay so I recently went shopping and decided I would save a few dollars by buying the Walmart brand bags of instant mashed potatoes instead of the Idahoan brand…big mistake. The Idahoan brand, at least to me, ALWAYS taste pretty much exactly like homemade; no weird tastes. Walmart brand for the most part has never let me down when it comes to a cheaper substitute, but their instant mashed potatoes however- are disgusting. I can’t quite explain this odd taste the GV mash has but the only way to explain is they sort of lack the taste of potatoes and taste more like chemicals/sour. With Idahoan I honestly have to add nothing to them but I still add a little salt, a generous amount of pepper and maybe the tiniest bit of butter. So I did the same to the GV instant potatoes and…they’re gross. It’s like eating straight chemicals and I’m curious if anyone that eats the GV instant mash has any tips to make it taste more edible instead of like a chemical cousin to actual potatoes, lol. I have butter and the typical seasonings and milk and cheese but I’m not sure it will do much to make these potatoes more appetizing for future meals.",budgetfood
