## Problem Statement
>FINAL TBD
>DRAFT: As a data scientist at a leading food delivery/ghost kitchen company, you've been tasked with market research that includes analyzing data on food value, food keywords, nutrition habits, physical activity levels, and obesity rates, and other factors, to identify distinct market segments across states and determine top menu items to deliver. Your goal is to develop at least one model that will enable targeted marketing campaigns and tailored menu offerings, presenting the top state clusters or groups with recommendations for top menu items.

## Data Dictionary

Four data sets are included in this project:

|Feature|Type|Dataset|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|**budgetfood.csv**|*dtypes: float64(1), object(3)*|Reddit|Dataset pulled using PRAW from subreddit /budgetfood|
|**finedining.csv**|*dtypes: float64(1), object(3)*|Reddit|Dataset pulled using PRAW from subreddit /finedining|
|**cdc_npao.csv**|*dtypes: float64(6), int64(3), object(24)*|Data.world|Dataset from Data.world: CDC Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity by State|
|**food-deserts-data-for-the-usa_csv-1.csv**|*dtypes: float64(1), object(3)*|CDC|Dataset from Data.world: Food Deserts data for the United States|

## Data Description for Audience - Food Delivery Company

CDC_NPAO will be used for a model/analysis that can inform location decisions that take into consideration Income and Education, among other factors, that make up prime target marketing demographics.

Food-Deserts... will be used for a model/analysis that can inform location decisions that take into consideration Population and Poverty rate, among other factors, that make up prime marketing demographcs.

BudgetFood and FineDining datasets will be used to create a classification model that will help quickly distinguish optimal high volume paid and organic search keyword terms and high net revenue menu item selection, with classification that optimizes cheap foods over expensive foods that are popular, without the need to derive each of its ingredients values individually.  

This model can also be used on a future survey of the customers top favorite menu items or other data obtained in the future in whatever areas eating habit data can be obtained, and in the area determined by the analysis on the other two datasets, which will help to start food delivery decision making to decide on what to sell first, in a way that reduces costs, and improves likelihood of sales.

These models all combine to enhance the market research and product development for this new venture.
